## 💵 Monetization

Void Survivors is a free-to-play game that relies on in-app purchases to monetize the game.

Monetization is driven by two strategies:
1. Class unlocks.
2. Character customization.

The following will be part of the monetization strategy:\
✅ No loot boxes or other gambling mechanics.\
✅ No pay-to-win mechanics.\
✅ No pay-to-earn mechanics.\
✅ No cryptocurrency or NFTs.\
✅ No data harvesting or selling of user data.

## 🔓 Class Unlocks

Players will have the option for playing a variety of free classes, including Paladin 🛡️,  Healer ❤️‍🩹, Archer 🏹, and Rogue 🗡️. More exotic classes will be unlockable through a purchasing option.

Players are able to change classes at any time during a session. This allows the player to be dynamic to the needs of the team and to their current situation, eg if a player is in a tight spot surrounded by fire they can switch to the elementalist class 🔥 to absorb the fire through the elementalist ability and escape safely.

Classes will reach a maximum progression and player's can extend their progression in the game by purchasing new classes.

This provides three motivations for the player to purchase a class:
1. Increases survivability due to having more utility.
2. Increases value to team due to being able to change to class that the team is lacking.
3. Increased progression in the game.

As the game is supported new classes will be released.

This is a common monetization strategy in games that have numerous characters or character classes, including RPGs and fighting games.

Games that have used this strategy successfully include:
* League of Legends
* Multiversus
* Rainbow six siege

This strategy allows for integration into subscription services, eg Xbox's Games Pass, where players on the subscription will have all classes unlocked whilst they play the game through that services interface. This is a new strategy that is being tested by League of Legends and is yet to be proven.

## 🎩👒🤠🧑‍🎄 Character Customization

Players will want to express their individuality, especially in larger groups where they may get lost in a crowd of similar looking player classes. Players will be able purchase skins to customize their characters. Each class will have unique skins, allowing a player to purchase unique looks for each of their classes.

This is a common monetization strategy that was first popularized by League of Legends and has been used in most free-to-play games.

Games that have used this strategy successfully include:
* CSGO
* Dota 2
* Valorant
* Among Us
* Rust

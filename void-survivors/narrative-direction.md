* Players play in a void and spawn life around them. The longer they stay in one spot the more lush the life becomes, the larger it becomes, but the more it attracts the void to lash back against it.

* All about cooperation, and banding together

* Inspiration: The void in Shadow and Bone.

It begs to question, with enough players spreading bringing into the void life would the void be quenched entirely?

* Inspiration: hyper light drifter

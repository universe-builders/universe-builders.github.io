We develop games with no segregation or exclusionary mechanics, such as skill level, time invested, or geographic location. Void Survivors is designed with hyper accessibility in mind to support as many players in as many situations as possible. Void Survivors has currently considered accessibility for the following groups: 👍 Players with vision impairments. 👍 Players with movement impairments. 👍 Players with input requirements and preferences, including accessibility controllers. 👍 Players with cognitive impairments and ADHD. 👍 Players with different skill levels. 👍 Players in low socio-economic environments. 👍 Players in low-connectivity networking environments, such as public transport or on mobile networks. 👍 Players in low-bandwidth networking environments, such as remote areas. 👍 Players with different gameplay motivations, such as preferring to avoid combat or stressful situations.

Void Survivors runs on numerous devices without any restriction of cross playing between them. The design of Void Survivors strongly considered how to present a game that feels like a native experience regardless of whether you are playing on a touch interface mobile device, on a laptop with a keypad, or on a desktop with a gamepad. The design process included excluding mechanics that wouldn’t be accessible on certain devices, such as precise targetting mechanics on touch devices, and distilling the UI to be appropriate on large and small screens. The choice of technologies ensured that we are able to successfully produce a game that can run effectively on a large set of devices and inputs, specifically by choosing Web as the target platform and investing in custom technology to optimize for it. The devices that Void Survivors will be avilable on are MacOSX, Linux, Windows, iPhone, and Android. ",

To support low-powered devices (low CPU, GPU, and battery life) common in low socio-economic environments it is vital to make the game as efficent as possible on those devices. This was a strong consideration in the choosing of the game genre and mechanics, eg: . | the art style is a highly-optimizable voxel representation, ideal for small GPUs | the physics is simplistic with little collision resolution, ideal for small CPUs | the AI is simplistic with behaviors able to be reused for numerous agents in the group, ideal for small CPUs | the inputs are minimal are work well on small and large screens, and using touch, gamepad, or keyboard | .

The game was designed in a way to be playable with minimal inputs, including using just one finger tapping or holding for mobile devices, as some movement impairments disallow tapping or holding a control for extended periods. Different control schemes will be offered, and are appropriate, for the game including click-to-move and hold-to-move, where hold-to-move is often problematic for those with hand movement impairments.

However most games require large downloads before being able to play the game, and typical engines perpetuate this problem by offering little support to streaming assets and minimizing build sizes. Void Survivors will require no installation, by the nature of the Web, and the initial download size will be optimized to package the bare minimum assets, in a highly compressed format, and further assets will be streamed in on demand. Assets will be offered in various definitions - allowing users to specify downloading standard-definition assets or high-definition assets based on their requirements.

Most games usually use TCP-based networking transport or a connection based UDP networking transport, which are both very intolerant of network jitter and only support those players with high connectivity and a consistent connection. These players have been supported in Void Survivors, by choosing a connectionless UDP-based networking transport which is highly tolerant of dropped and corrupted data. Further, a peer-to-peer networking topology will be leveraged, using WebRTC, which allows for players to connect directly to other players, instead of having to be routed through a server that may be geographically distant from them. These approaches allow for a highly tolerant networking environment where users can lose connectivity for extended periods of time without being removed or disconnected from a session, and allows for lower latency and better experience for players in remote areas.

Universe Builders strives to make games that have no exclusionary or segregation mechanics to allow a large range of skill levels and player motivations access to our games. The foremost way that Void Survivors allows players of different skill levels and motivations to play together is by offering a range of character classes that have different play styles and skill level requirements. For example the Healer class can be played with low skill level and in a purely team support way, as they are motivated away from combat and towards groups of players. This class is ideal for players that do not want to engage in the stress of combat and for low-skill players. In contrast the Rogue class is recommended to have high skill level and for players wanting an action oriented combat experience, as it requires environmental awareness, is combat focused, and to play effectively requires strategic risk taking. Having this wide range of skill level accessibility means that players can choose a class that suits them at a particular point in time, and allows players with little experience to be impactful and valuable to a team.

    "content": "These pillars help drive decisions and direction in all aspects of the art for Void Survivors. 🗝️ Hyper Accessible . Void Survivors should support as many people as possible, on as many devices as possible, in as many situations as possible. 🔓 Accessible graphics that are clear and understandable at a glance. 🔓 Low hardware requirements (Older phones, laptops, …). 🔓 Consideration for individuals with visual impairments. 🔓 Low download requirements for low bandwidth tolerance. 🔓 Streamable assets for downloading on demand. 🔓 The graphics should be appropriate for players PG+. 🔥 Destruction . Void Survivors has a primary player motivation for destruction, ie explosions, flashy visual effects, objects being smashed apart, and general mayhem. 🎆 All objects should be destructable and breakable, in a performant manner. 🎆 Particle effects and other VFX should be highly leveraged. 📍 Low Fidelity . The simulation of Void Survivors is lower fidelity than many action titles, specifically by using simpler physics🎾 (collision and resolution) and artificial intelligence🧠 than most action titles. This is to allow performant computation on low-end hardware and allows for large swarms of enemies and players in a single team. The art style should reinforce this this. As detailed in the ‘Kingdoms and Castles’ postmortem, players expect higher fidelity simulation the higher fidelity the graphics are. Kingdoms and Castles chose a very low-fidelity art style to match their low-fidelity simulation, and received critical and commercial success. Kingdoms and castles postmorem (GDC Vault) . 🐲 Fantastical . Void Survivors is set in an environment that is whimsical and light hearted. It avoids heavy themes, horror elements, and realism. Players should get a sense of wonder and delight in the environment and elements within Void Survivors. The combat will be highly stylized and not use gore, blood, or any other violent themes. 🧚 Effects should be comical and highly animated. 🧚 Themes should be vibrant. 🧚 Invaders should be based in fantasy and myth.

    "doc": "🎨 Art Direction",
    "title": "👉 Direction 👉",
    "content": "To reinforce the art pillars, these sections define more specific direction to be followed in the construction of the art for Void Survivors. 👉 Voxel based models . Voxel based models are highly compressible compared to typical triangle based meshes, allowing for a huge amount of content to be transmitted to clients with a small amount of bandwidth. Voxel models are easily procedurally destructable compared to typical triangle based meshes. This is achieved simply by adding force to the cubes in the voxel mesh allowing for explosions and other effects - compared to a typical triangle based mesh destruction system that requires definition of fragments which has a production and asset size overhead. Voxel based models are low fidelity, reinforcing the low fidelity nature of the simulation. The following reference images demonstrate voxel based meshes in games. Source: Stone Hearth Source: Stone Hearth Source: Minecraft Source: Minecraft . 👉 Isometric View . Having an isometric view allows for higher device accessibility and control scheme, as well as performance optimizations. The isometric view provides simplicity when panning and zooming a camera, allowing for a simple control scheme. The isometric view is great at providing perspective of relative sizes of elements, and is used frequently outside of games for visualization purposes which makes it more accessible to players without much experience in games. Having a fixed isometric view, opposed to a perspective camera, allows for optimizing the rendering pipeline which will make it more performant on lower end devices. Further, isometric views require less graphical computation, compared to that of a perspective based renderer due to orthographic projections being the default projection of renderers. The following reference images demonstrate the isometric viewpoint. Source: Team Porcupine Source: Wakfu Source: Unity . 👉 Flat World . Having a flat world, with no terrain altitude, allows for simpler controls and world generation. A flat world is very simple to procedurally generate, compared to that of a world with different levels of terrain which requires mountains, rivers, and lakes. This reduces the production cost to develop the world. A flat world makes Void Survivors far more accessible from a control scheme standpoint, requiring only panning and zooming to be able to interact effectively. In a non-flat world, rotating is required as objects may be obscured by terrain, eg an object hiding behind a mountain. The following reference images demonstrate flat worlds. Source: Kingdoms and castles Source: Age of Empires Source: The Fertile Crescent . 👉 Desaturated colors and highlighted elements . There will be a large number of players and invaders on screen at once and it’s important to remove cluttering from the screen. To achieve this, damaging elements and elements that players should focus on (eg players that are dangerously close to being defeated when playing the healer class) should be highlighted and pop out of the background. There are damaging elements in Void Survivors that should be clear to the player, so they can avoid damage and live as long as their skill allows them to, and provide them a high sense of locus of control. The following reference images demonstrate desaturated colors of elements except for a few key elements that should draw the players attention. Source: Deaths Door Source: Deaths Door Source: Tunic Source: Hades Source: Enter the gungeon Source: Hades . 👉 Flat Colors with gradients . To minimize on the assets required to play Void Survivors, textural elements should be used sparingly. Instead,flat colors and gradients, which can be encoded in a very small amount of mathematical code, should be used. Flat colors offer visual simplicity which reduces the noise that textural elements can create on small screens. Flat colors make it easier to customize for visual impairments, and preferences can be provided to players (eg changing damaging elements from a red color to a player’s preferred color). The following reference images demonstrate games that use flat colors with gradients and sparingly use textual elements. Source: Deaths Door Source: Cube World Source: Cube World Source: Stone Hearth Source: Tunic Source: Tunic Source: Calder Moore - Artstation Source: Minecraft Dungeons Source: Minecraft Dungeons Source: Unrailed Source: Calder Moore - Artstation Source: Stone Hearth . 👉 Soft lighting and shadows . Void Survivors is set in a fantasy environment that is whimsical and light hearted. To reinforce this, soft lighting and shadows should be used as opposed to realistic simulation of lighting and shadows. The following reference images demonstrate soft lighting and shadows. Source: Deaths Door Source: Deaths Door Source: Hades Source: Tunic Source: Tunic . 👉 Stylized Textures . Void Survivors is set in a fantasy environment that is whimsical and light hearted. To reinforce this, stylized and handpainted textures should be used opposed to realistic textures. The following reference images demonstrate stylized handpainted textures and elements. Source: Andrii Tuzenko - Artstation Source: Andrii Tuzenko - Artstation Source: Sephiroth Art - Artstation . 👉 Character limbs aren’t attached . Having characters limbs (hands, feet) not be attached to their torso allows for a far simpler key-frame animation system which is computationally less expensive, easier to produce assets for, and requires less bandwidth to transmit animated assets. The following reference images demonstrate models without their limbs attached. Source: Stone Hearth . ",

Bullet-Hell games are an old genre dating back to arcade titles where the player has to dodge patterns of incoming projectiles. Bullet-Heaven reverses this and the player is the source of a huge amount of projectiles which seek to destroy enemies. Players strive to make effecient patterns of attacks that defeat incoming invaders with all sorts of properties, such as large numbers, high health, and small collision regions. Bullet-Heaven games typically use Swarm-Defense mechanics. Source: Youtube ‘Kalle Gaming’ . Games in this genre that inspire Void Survivors: . | Realm of the Mad God | . ",

    "content": "Void Survivors targets players with the following motivations. The primary motivations take precedence in all decision making and secondary motivations are supported to allow for a broader audience appeal. 🤝 Cooperation . Players are highly motivated to join as a community, to seek each other out, and to team up. Players progress faster in groups and are able to directly help each other using abilities. The game is optimally played with a pre-existing community, but solo players can join any team with no restrictions. 🏆 Competition . Teams will have statistics📊 of individual performance (damage, healing, …) displayed at all times which will motivate competitive players to top the team leaderboard. This allows shareable moments within communities. 🔥 Destruction . The combat will cause over the top destruction (explosions, mayhem) to the environment and entities within, in a fireworks-display-esque comical manner. It should be suprising, enjoyable, and candy for your eyes. 😮 Excitement . The game will be fast paced, ramping up quickly until a point of overwhelming the player. It will be full of surprises and intense moments, eg when massive waves of enemies or specifically threatening enemies spawn “There’s a dragon!!! Watch out everyone!!”. Players should walk away from a 15 minute session feeling thrilled. Source: Quantic Foundry . The choices for these primary motivations were informed by player psychology research conducted by Quantic Foundry, which provides a framework to relate player motivations. Specifically Coopereration🤝, Competition🏆, and Destruction🔥 motivations are all highly correlated - meaning a player motivated with one is highly likely to be motivated by the others. 💪 Secondary: Power . In a 15 minute session players will rapidly progress in their class by obtaining abilities. In the metagame players can upgrade and empower their class by expending earned currency. 🏆 Secondary: Completion . Players will be able to unlock a variety of achievements based on personal performance in their team and through progression in their classes. The list of achievements will be publicly available so that players can strive for them. Players can also pay to unlock various outfits and seasonal items which will appeal to completionists, See Monetization Plan for more info. 🔎 Secondary: Discovery . Players will be able to discover a variety of unique and different environments, classes, achievements, and enemies over their sessions. ✍️ Secondary: Design . Players will be able to customize their characters using meta game progression and through in-app purchases as part of the monetization strategy. See Monetization Plan for more info. Source: Quantic Foundry . 🙅‍♂️ Motivations not focused on . The game will not focus on the following player motivations: . | Challenge: The game will not focus on challenging mechanics as this would provide incentive for segregating teams based on competency or teams to exclude members based on skill level. There will be some challenge and mastery to the game, however random chance and random team compositions will make individual mastery less important than other game elements. | Strategy: The game will not promote or require strategic thinking, at most some classes do require short term tactical thinking, and players can choose abilities tactically based on other players’ choices. Random spawns of enemies will nullify any long term strategy, and promote short term dynamic reactivity. Strategic thinking opposes the short play session length and communication mechanisms that the game is designed around. | Fantasy/Story: The game will not focus on allowing roleplaying of characters, nor will it invest highly in level design with rich dynamic storytelling, or in portraying a deep story through use of characters. The game a strong atmospheric theme and the stories generated in the game should be emergent and created, shared, and told by communities as opposed to being told to players through the game. | .

Characters will attack the nearest threat automatically, players need not aim attacks or choose targets. This is a characteristic mechanic of the bullet-heaven genre. 🔥 Character classes have unique abilities . Each character class has unique abilities that can be used to directly help team mates. For example: 🛡️ Paladin: Block and reflect attacks. 🦎 Tamer: Can tame invaders into friendly pets. 🌷 Druid: Can grow defensive fauna. ⚠️ Telegraphed abilities and attacks . All abilities and attacks, from friends or enemies, will be telegraphed to allow the players to react to it. Players are able to get out of the way of enemy attacks and ensure they take advantage of any team mates abilities (eg a heal). 💪 Rapid Progression and ability unlocks . At the start of each session, a character has only the default abilities and gains new abilities rapidly over a 15 minute session. Each minute or so, chosen from a set of three random abilities. Players of each class will be given the same ability choices, and will see the abilities other players choose, so they can tactically to choose the same abilities or have a mixture of abilities on the team. 🙏 Stacked abilities . When a player uses an ability, such as an area based heal, other players will have the opportunity to stack their ability on top of it. This allows for stronger abilities that are only possible with numerous collaborating team mates.

The prototype game designer can be undertaken by a junior level, as the technology stack is well known and the quality of the code and project need only survive for the usage of playtesting. Publicly available assets will be highly leveraged. The art director will be a once off consultant, ideally with significant experience in setting an art direction. The concept artist, UI designer, and artist roles can be fulfilled by one person. If it is hard to find a person with all three skill sets, they can be seperated and contracted at different points in the development. The programming, tool development, and game development responsibilities will be undertaken by James Knight, which allows for an efficent development synergy of the engine, editor, and development frameworks. Future versions of these roles will be open for contractors and the technology will be in a stable and documented state to allow ease of onboarding and development. At this phase there needs to be a lot of decisions around architecture which requires an experience programmer, which James Knight will fulfill. ⚠️ Pre-Production: Risks &amp; Mitigations ✅ . ⚠️ The ‘Game Developer’ role will be hard or expensive to source The custom game engine uses technologies that are less common for game developers to possess. Specifically, Web based technologies are not common for game developers to have. Further, the use of the C language is infrequently used in games where C# (Unity) and C++ (Unreal Engine) are more common. Further, game developers are generally wary of joining companies with unique tech stacks due to the low transferability of skills to other employers. ✅ Unreal Engine developers would fit better than Unity developers in C programming, as C++ (Unreal) is far closer in language to C than C# (Unity). When hiring, preference those with Unreal or C++ skills. ✅ The engine leverages numerous libraries that reduce the complexity of C, specifically by providing Data Structures and Algorithms that can be used out of the box. ✅ The engine is architected in a way that all of the logic touched by Game Developers will be in C, and no knowledge or understanding of Web technologies is required. Specifically shaders are in typical GLSL and all logic is transpiled into WebAssembly and run on the Web without any input required from the developer. ✅ Developers can be excited by new technologies, as they do not carry the legacy baggage that frustrates developers in the Unity and Unreal ecosystems. This could be a huge selling point when hiring. ✅ Developers looking to upskill in new technologies would fit well, this could be a selling point when hiring. ⚠️ The programmer role is highly specialized and will be hard or expensive to source The programmer role requires a bunch of specialized skills, specifically engine development, multiplayer knowledge, kubernetes expertise, … . ✅ James Knight will be undertaking this role for the duration of the project, and has 10+ years experience in developing such technologies. ✅ In future milestones, programmer contractors will have access to a more abstracted, stable, and documented technology - allowing for development without the expertise of those specialized skills. ⚠️ Art will be too computationally or graphically expensive for target hardware . ✅ As part of the refinement of the art direction the programmer should be included with respect to hypothesising and validating the performance of the art. This should be incorporated to the stress testing of the client. If the art is too expensive, then concessions must be made on the art or the minimum required hardware. ⚠️ Asset pipelines are inoptimal leading to slow development iteration As the custom engine may not be optimal for the artist to integrate their work, test it out in the game engine renderer, and test it with gameplay – as the tooling may not exist or be immature. ✅ The programmer will be working along side the artist to define and implement appropriate pipelines. ✅ The artist is able to continue work in isolation of their tool, MagicaVoxel, to implement the models and animations as it has in built support for the Isometric camera that will also be used within the game. Due to the simplistic level design, little consideration is needed with respect to composing models within a complicated scene. ⚠️ Transitioning the game-genre into multiplayer requires extensive design iterations and testing The Survivors-Like genre is mostly single-player, with only one game in the genre that supports two players. Because this genre has never been combined with MMO it may require a lot of work to get them to mesh together coherently. ✅ To front load this risk, ideally before testing the vertical-slice, there will be a number of prototypes created in Unity to experiment with many of the least refined mechanics of the game. ✅ Whilst there are no Survivors-Like games, there are numerous games that are in the MMO space that contain similar gameplay mechanics which do work exceptionally well - such as Realm of the Mad God and certain dungeons in World of Warcraft. Taking inspiration from these titles provides a set of tools that is proven to work in this general genre. ⚠️ James Knight has too many programming responsibilities to deliver the milestone on time . ✅ The Tool Developer 🔨 role can be contracted out without much risk to expense. (See Opportunities below). ✅ The vertical slice has been defined to allow appropriately distributing programming work to other milestones. ✅ Contractors can be hired for specific tasks, such as creating the CI/CD pipeline. ✅ Time estimations include expectations that these roles will be undertaken by one person.

    "content": "✅ Web developers can be contracted for tooling 🔨 Most game development tool positions requires expertise that generally falls outside a typical game developer’s skill set, and are generally less attractive roles because they are supporting development opposed to working on the game directly. As the engine focuses on a Web based platform deployment, the editor will focus on the Web Browser as the native development tool. This opens up the ability to hire to web developers, of which the market is saturated with Web Developers and the cost of contracting a web developer is significantly lower than a typical Game Tool developer. Further, the Web has the richest ecosystem of tooling via pre-build packages than any other ecosystem (npm). These tools can be leveraged opposed to developing them directly, reducing the development timeline and increasing the quality of tooling. ✅ Juniors can be contracted for prototyping James Knight has been teaching Unity developers for 3+ years and has access to a wide network of junior level game developers. Due to the technology choices and requirements of the prototype, juniors are able to develop effectively and autonomously. ✅ Leveraging James Knight’s specialization to produce a genre that is under supplied As seen in the market-research, the genres of Void Survivors is under supplied, specifically in the MMO genre. James Knight has 8+ years working as an engineer, designer, and product manager for MMO game and technology development. This experience is highly leveraged during the development of Void Survivors.

It is paired with three sub-genres which are undersupplied (Roguelite, Bullet-Heaven, Swarm-Defense), and one sub-genre that is oversupplied (Action). There is concern with action games being the third most popular genre on Steam as it may be hard to differentiate in that competitive market, especially when a lot of the game-loop of Void Survivors revolves around action. Action however is the largest market size of all the genre’s of Void Survivors meaning the demand is high for the genre. Hack and slash, dungeon crawlers, and roguelikes all have a low average price compared to other genres (~$11.50). This may be an advantage as Void Survivors is a free-to-play game and players of these genre’s expect to pay relatively low for those genres, but may be an indicator that players are willing to spend less and convert less into paying players.

    "title": "☁️ Psychographic Segmentation",
    "content": "Psychographic segmentation is used to define personas which guide development and marketing in Void Survivors. The following personas are the target personas for the game until release. 🤝 Persona: Community Member . The community member is someone who is looking to socialize, interact, and fit in with a community. They want to feel integrated within community and are looking to cooperate and compete within it. They are open to new experiences as long as they are social in nature. They enjoy competitive and challenging situations where they can personally stand out in their community. They enjoy cooperating with a team to overcome challenges and achieve unique rewards. The community member plays on a low/mid powered PC, laptop, or mobile device. They are highely engaged in the voice chat or text chat of their community, preferring their community chat to an in-game chat, and aren’t entirely focused on the game. They are skilled at video games and are familiar with traditional mechanics, input controls, and tropes. The community member likes achievements and status rewards which can be flaunted within their community, such as high scores and personal achievements. The community member discovers games using the community they are a part of. They tend to play games based on the trends in their community so they can feel integrated. The community member is willing to spend money on rewards that will make them stand out from their community, through unique class or cosmetics, or that provide them recognition and status within their community. 👉 Persona: Community Organizer . The community organizer is someone who is always looking for games they can play with their friends, family, or community. They are looking for accessible experiences that can be shared with a diverse set of people, with a range of different devices, skills, and tastes. They avoid experiences that may need lots of explaining (rules), that may cause technical difficulties, or be exclusionary to members of their community. The community organizer plays on a high powered PC or on a large screen in a social environment, their community plays on laptops or mobile devices. Their community wants to play together without interruption by other players, and wants the ability to socially interact with each other. The community organizer looks for games that are mechanics focused opposed to story or theme focused. Ideally the game will allow for emergent storytelling which will form stronger bonds in their community through shared experiences and stories. The community organizer will move players on from experiences if they are getting overwhelming or frustrating at the end of the session, and rarely during a session. The community organizer discovers games using filtering in Steam or similar app for cooperative, competitive, couch games, and other specific tags. They will consider a large number of games in their discovery and quickly determine appropriate games by looking at the marketing materials. The community organizer is willing to spend money on rewards that will benifit their entire team and on cosmetics which help themselves stand out from their community. 🚌 Persona: Transit Player . The transit player is someone who doesn’t have much time to play. They have a personal mobile device or a work PC in which they can play on. They are looking for a quick dopamine hit and stress relief whilst they are on break, awaiting a meeting, or their station while on public transport. They are not entirely focused on the game, as they may be in a distracting or social environment. The transit player is attracted to pick up and play mechanics, they want to jump into the action straight away, and don’t want any risk for putting down the game at a moments notice. They do not engage in voice chat and rarely in text chat to communicate, instead focusing on their solo experience. The transit player is attracted to destruction, combat, and high octane mechanics. They are more excited to join an existing game in the flow of action, opposed to a slow burn in ramping up to the action. The transit player discovers games by top games on mobile store or by hearing about it from a friend or influencer. They will quickly move on from a game if it doesn’t seem to be engaging or enjoyable. They prefer small download size and near-instant experiences. The transit player is willing to spend small amounts of money on spontaneous decisions if they believe it will lead to tangible enjoyment and progression rewards that can be seen immediately. Persona: Solo Player . This persona is for players that want to play a game and discover team mates to play with. This persona is a secondary focus until the Beta milestone. To be completed by the Producer in the Alpha milestone. See Development Plan for more info. Persona: Survivors-like genre Fan .

    "title": "🗺️ Marketing Strategy",
    "content": "Void Survivors allows players to join an existing game session by using a simple web browser link. The marketing strategy is focused on user acquisition by engaging with existing synchronous gaming communities to motivate community members to join existing sessions, start and share their own session, and eventually have the community provide a permanant session link. Further, the strategy focuses on user retention through the formation of a Discord server and an email list. The strategy focuses on syncrhonous game communities, ie Discord and Twitch, as opposed to asychronous forums such as Reddit or Facebook, as the optimal way the game is discovered is by players joining a link to a live session shared on a community they are a part of. To achieve this, the following user acquision strategies will be deployed: . | Engage existing Discord gaming communities. | Engage players that enjoy Survivors-like genre. | Sponsor game streamers to play with their communities. | Distribution by platforms with existing player bases. | . Further, the following user retention strategies will be deployed: . | Foster a Discord gaming community and email list around the game. | . 📌 User Acquisition Strategy: Engaging existing Discord gaming communities . This strategy focuses on acquiring new players through existing gaming communities, specifically Discord communities. Examples of existing Discord gaming communities: . | Socializing : 169k members. | Tribe Gaming : 90k members. | Aura Gaming : 40k members. | . To achieve this, the following steps will be undertaken: . | Identify Discord gaming communities, join, and engage*. | Occasionally post a link to an existing session, looking for online community members to join. | Engage the community owners to post a permanant link to a session, this allows their community to be discovered by other players in game - increasing their community size. | . *It’s important to engage consistently and for a long period, as some communities have posting restrictions, which disallow new or inactive users from posting. This strategy is common in Reddit/Facebook forums, and it is very hard to cut through the noise without paid promotion. However this strategy is not common in synchronous communities as the lifetime of posts is very short. This strategy is modern, as over the last few years many online communities have moved from Facebook/Reddit to Discord. This strategy focuses on the main user target, that of a person in a gaming community looking to play and interact with others in the community. The final step of this strategy is for communities to post a permalink for Void Survivors in their community, this allows players in their community to join at any time and be placed with others in that community. The main advantage for the community is that it can be organically discovered by players within the game, increasing the community user base. Further incentives are affiliation rewards of purchases by community members, and in-game boosts for community members. This strategy requires no financial investment and a continual small time investment by having accounts active and engaged in a number of gaming communities. This strategy will be executed upon during the Beta milestone and persist into Live Ops, after release. 📌 User Acquisition Strategy: Sponsoring game streamers to play with their communities . This strategy is about acquiring new players through existing gaming communities around a Twitch streamer. Void Survivors provides a unique and highly interactive way for Twitch streamers to engage with their audience. It provides a lot of value in that alone. Ideally this value for streamers will be enough to motivate streamers to invite their communities without explicit partnership or sponsorship. Twitch streamers like to engage with their audience through a variety of activities, including chatting, content sharing, and games. There are very few games that allow Twitch streamers to interact with their communities, due to player size limits, pay walls, or unfair advantages gained by being able to view the streamers’ screen. Void Survivors is uniquely positioned in that it has no restrictions or drawbacks for sharing. To achieve this strategy, streamers with small followings (~100 CCU) will be engaged with an affiliation partnership on purchases by their viewers and/or sponsorship costs. Ideally streamers with larger audiences will see a trend of smaller streamers engaging with Void Survivors, which motivates them to play and share with their stream. This strategy would benifit from financial investment. If no marketing budget is able to support this effort, then affiliation program’s should be mature and accessible to execute this strategy without sponsorship. This strategy will be executed upon after the Release milestone. 📌 User Acquisition Strategy: Engaging players that enjoy the Survivors-like genre. This strategy is about acquiring new players through engaging with players that enjoy the Survivors-like genre through posting on existing game forums and communities. As determined in the market research there is a huge amount of players enjoying the Survivors-like genre and are demanding new entrants in this genre. This demand means players will be looking for similar titles through the channels of, YouTube comments, Reddit, Facebook, Steam comments, and recommendation sites. This strategy involves engaging on as many of these channels to spread the word of a new entrant in the field, Void Survivors. This strategy requires no financial investment. This strategy will be executed upon during the Beta milestone and persist into Live Ops, after release. 📌 User Acquisition Strategy: Distribution by platforms with existing player bases . This strategy is about acquiring new players through distribution on platforms with existing player bases. As Void Survivors is deployed to Web, we are able to distribute the game for free via web game distributors such as Newgrounds, Kongregate, and Armor Games. Each of these platforms have over 100K monthly users and distribute web games without royalty or cost. Further, the Steam platform is a primary target for release. There are lots of opportunities to integrate features for specific platforms, such as achievements, and recommending groups that are using that specific platform. This strategy requires minimal financial investment, only integrations with each distribution platform’s specific achievement, social, and other services. This strategy will be executed upon after the Release milestone. 📌 User Retention Strategy: Foster a discord gaming community around the game . This strategy focuses on increasing player retention by creating a centralized community in Discord, which sends notifications, and by building an email list. This strategy is about creating a centralized community in Discord for players to engage with the game, including finding existing sessions and players to play with, and to keep up with the development of the game. The community will increase keep player retention through consistent updates and events, which are sent out as notifications on Discord and via email. The achieve this, the following steps will be undertaken: . | Set up a Discord server under the games’ name. | Provide a link to the Discord server in the game. | Set up group channels, allowing players to join active groups and join via their link. | Host events, such as double XP via specific links. | Provide channels to interact with developers, and development updates. | . Games that have used this strategy successfully to foster server’s with 10k+ players are: . | GTFO | Dark and Darker | PUBG | . Upon joining, players will be asked for their email address for infrequent communications about the game. This email list will be used to send an email once per month for events and game updates. This will increase player retention. The community will have release updates and development changelogs for the game. This will be posted as a notification to draw interest from players, get them hyped for the update, and increase player retention. The community will have opportunities for players to engage with developers and the development, through polls and channels that have direct communication with developers. This allows us to receive and react to player feedback. This strategy requires no financial investment, only time investment in having accounts active and engaged in a number of gaming communities. A small financial invesment is optional for more discord community features which can be added if this strategy has proven to be successful. This strategy will be executed upon during the Alpha milestone and persist into Live Ops, after release. ",

    "content": "Players will have the option for playing a variety of free classes, including Paladin 🛡️, Healer ❤️‍🩹, Archer 🏹, and Rogue 🗡️. More exotic classes will be unlockable through a purchasing option. Players are able to change classes at any time during a session. This allows the player to be dynamic to the needs of the team and to their current situation, eg if a player is in a tight spot surrounded by fire they can switch to the elementalist class 🔥 to absorb the fire through the elementalist ability and escape safely. Classes will reach a maximum progression and player’s can extend their progression in the game by purchasing new classes. This provides three motivations for the player to purchase a class: . | Increases survivability due to having more utility. | Increases value to team due to being able to change to class that the team is lacking. | Increased progression in the game. | . As the game is supported new classes will be released. This is a common monetization strategy in games that have numerous characters or character classes, including RPGs and fighting games. Games that have used this strategy successfully include: . | League of Legends | Multiversus | Rainbow six siege | . This strategy allows for integration into subscription services, eg Xbox’s Games Pass, where players on the subscription will have all classes unlocked whilst they play the game through that services interface. This is a new strategy that is being tested by League of Legends and is yet to be proven. ",

Players will have opportunities to thank boosters through emoji responses or directly in chat - “Thanks User123 for the boost! You’re awesome!”. Individuals in a group, or small teams may strategize, to purchase any missing boosts to ensure maximum progress advantage. This allows players to exchange money for increased progress and status within their community. Boosts will be limited in their effectiveness, and not stackable.

Few survived the catastrophy and are confronted with an inert barren void replacing the industrius civilization before it. Those that did survive find themselves with an ability to summon life into the desolate void. These survivors bring hope for the world to return to a natural haven filled with the wonders of life. Survivors band together to spread life in the void and provide sanctuary to all those that happen upon it. However, these sanctuary builders are not the only inhabitants within this new world. Attracted to life, like a moth to a flame, are void dwelling creatures of myth and legend. These void creatures contain the rage of the catastrophy and have an unrelenting desire to rid the world of all life.

    "content": "The launch strategy is going to be broken up into 4 parts. | The Community. | Relationship Building. | Pre-release. | Release. | . The Community . We are going to build our own community through Discord. Our community is going to be primarily focused on our game, sharing experiences, updates, builds, and playtests. Our objective is to have a similar and strong community like Dark and Darker and Ashes of Creation. We are also going to work with various media such as podcasts like Giant Bomb Cast, Game Scoop and Get Played to gain access to their communities. Further we will engage with discord groups, subreddits, and YouTube channels to increase exposure to our game. Relationship Building . During the development of our game we are going to prioritize relationships with streamers, aligned companies, and content creators. We aren’t going to pitch our game, but instead build relationships with the key figures behind these potential partnerships. The idea is to build a relationship, provide value to them, help them with any issue they are experiencing and then when the time comes to release the game we will ask for their help in promoting it and pre-promoting it. The goal is to build relationships with streamers, help them, and in exchange they can give us the exposure needed to hit the new and trending tab. This same tactic will apply to aligned companies like Stream Labs, Stream Legends and similar companies (one email from any of these companies promoting our game will be game changing). Pre-release . 60 days before the release of the game we are going to hype up our community, talk to our partners and organize promotions with all partners. Our goal during this stage is to get wishlists on Steam and to get people engaging with the store page before we go live. This will give us a significant edge to get to the new and trending (as well as providing pre-orders). Release . We are going to get our partners to promote the game on launch day and we are going to host a challenge for all partners and their community. We are going to host a challenge of who can survive the longest on launch day will win a cash prize of $1,000. Our target for this promotion will be smaller streamers with under 500 views. To promote this challenge we are going to follow 3 tactics: . | Get all of our partners who helped with pre-release an early access key for them and their community. | Three days before the release we are going to approach streamers who meet our criteria and approach them in two different ways, one will be an email from us providing them an early access key, the second way will be to donate to their streams notifying them of the challenge. This is inspired by the following successful campaigns by Ludwig. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip2trao6dYw&amp;pp=ygUQbHVkd2lnIG9tZWdhbHVsIA%3D%3D and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7ufQ5Sz-no). | We are going to open our discord for pre-registers for the challenge, this will allow us to build hype and competitively with the community. | . Summary . With all of these strategies combined we are confident that to reach the “New and Trending” tab on Steam. This will also provide us exposure that is ideally creating positive feedback loops that leads towards virality. ",

    "title": "🖥️🎮 Web Game Client Technology Stack",
    "content": "🌐 Web Browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, …) . Web browsers were chosen because they are available on all major platforms, including desktops, laptops, mobile phones, and even smart TV’s. It is the easiest way to make the game device inclusive. Web browsers have reached a maturity with their graphics fidelity (WebGL/WebGPU), their runtime performance (WASM), and their networking capabilities (WebRTC), to ensure that a low-fidelity game can be developed and run at a high-fps. Web applications can be packaged into native applications for PC, Mac, and mobile phones using progressive-web app technologies such as Electron. If the game wishes to leverage the hardware acceleration and API advantages of a native application, this route is a proven option. ✨ Simulation Architecture . The simulation architecture used will be an Entity-Component-System architecture using Data-Oriented principles to optimize performance for a large amount of unique entities on screen. This style of architecture has been popularized by Unity’s ECS implementation and has a proven ability to allow low-end hardware to support thousands of unique objects being simulated at high frame rates. 👾 Graphics . WebGL is the graphics library that will be targeted until WebGPU has reached mass availability, as currently it is only available in Chrome browsers. The graphics interface will be developed in-house, interfacing with WebGL directly, opposed to using an existing interface such as BabylonJS or ThreeJS. This was chosen as the graphical optimizations that can be realized for a voxel based graphical style outweigh the development cost of building this interface. Our team has previous expertise in developing such interfaces. Lot’s of the characters, enemies, and effects will be the same which will allow for instancing on the GPU to provide better frame rates for low end devices. 💡 Lighting . The lighting system should be simplistic and stylized instead of aiming for photorealism, ie it should avoid expensive lighting and shadow methods such as Raytracing and Shadow Mapping. 🎾 Physics . The physics in the game will be low-fidelity to reduce performance load on low-powered devices as the amount of collidable elements (players, invaders, …) will be high. The results of colliding with an enemy will not result in a physical reaction, such as being pushed back, but will result in damage taken. This results in far less computation required and thus supports lower-end hardware and is the typical behavior in bullet-heaven game. 🏃‍♀️ Animation . The animation in the game will be simple interpolation of key frames without using skeletal, procedural, or computationally expensive systems such as Inverse-Kinematics. This results in lower production cost for animations, a less computational expensive animation system, and less bandwidth required to transmit animated assets. 🧠 Artificial intelligence . The AI in the game will be simplistic to reduce performance load on low-powered devices as the amount of intelligent simulated agents (invaders) will be high. Invaders will be simulated using a simplistic finite state machine as it is highly performant, compared to that of behavior tree or more complicated GOAP graph, and will use simplistic steering behaviors (flocking, avoidance, interception, …) to create more sophisticated grouping behaviors. 🖧 Networking . WebRTC data channels will be used for the bulk of game communications as they are UDP based and ideal for low-latency low-bandwidth operations and allow for peer-to-peer connections at ~70% success rate for NAT punchthrough. It also removes the need for persistent connections which can be inconsistent on public transport and in low bandwidth environments, such as those in low socioeconomic areas. WebSockets will be used for communicating to content providers and other backend providers that do not require low latency, for usages such as streaming in required assets to play the game. HTTP REST requests will be used for communication to various API’s, such as authentication. 🖳 Language . WebAssembly will be the language that will run on each player’s device through the Web Browser. The team will use the C language to write logic which will then be transpiled into WebAssembly via the clang toolchain. The client engine is seperated into independent modules which include the core runtime engine and the game systems. Each game system is independently built and linked which allows for a quick iteration and runtime hot reloading when developing logic for a single system, opposed to needing build and reload the entire game. ❓ Why not use a pre-existing engine? . There are many engines that export a builds to the web, such as Unity, UE4, and Godot, however all of those options fail to hit several of the technical goals and accessibility targets that this game desires. Specifically, all of those engines struggle to export Web builds that run well on low-end hardware, even struggling to hit high frame rates on average gaming machines, and deliver game builds and assets that result in large initial downloads for users. Due to this these reasons, thse engines are a poor choice for meeting our accessibility goals. Further, getting those engines to support the high content density desired, in web exports, is a development challenge. There are engines specifically for developing web based games, such as BabylonJS and PlayCanvas, however those provide no feature support for the networking and high content density requirements for the game, and the advantages of each engine were not deemed justifyable for the restrictions imposed for this specific project. These engine options were investigated in the ideation phase of this project. The Web platform and low simulation &amp; graphical fidelity requirements of this game means that building a custom engine provides the ability to optimize around these requirements. In tests done in the ideation phase it was validated that the fidelity bar could be hit using a simple custom engine on low powered devices, running at a frame rate that exceeded all other tested engines. There are numerous web based games that have chosen to invest in their own engine, including Krunker.io debatably the most played 3D multiplayer web game available, and no discovered examples of web based 3D multiplayer games with 30+ FPS that were developed using one of the aforementioned engines. The content generation pipelines will however use existing technologies, specifically MagicaVoxel for generating 3D assets, and the engine will integrate with those. Although the initial cost for developing this technology is high it means the product is positioned in a place where it is hard for substitutes or new entrants. See the Accessibility Plan for more information on how a custom engine allows us to achieve a more accessible and better experience for our players. ",

    "content": "🎮 Game Server . Game servers will handle all non-client side interactions and ensuring the consistency of the simulation for all players. The game client will have a lot of authority regarding what events take place, such as whether a player was inflicted by damage, and the game server will do some light validation of these events. This poses the risk of players cheating, however as a cooperative game this will not have the exploitation rewards compared to a competitive game. The game server will flag any clear invalidations of the game rules which may result in a player being banned. The game server will be written in the C language and executed as binaries in the Alpine Linux OS inside of a container. Similar to the game client, each game system will be a seperate container and orchestrated seperately allowing for quick iteration speed in development and rolling updates to specific systems in production. Game servers will have authority over a single team and will handle migrating new teams as teams merge or seperate. As new teams form game servers will be horizontally scaled to account for the new team. Game servers will be vertically scalable to account for a team changing in size dramatically, ie as a team grows in player numbers it will have more hardware resources available to it. Game servers will be spatially distributed to allow players exploring the void to enter and exit them through moving in the game world. Once target devices have been identified, during development performance tests will continously be run to ensure that the devices have consistent and high performance. One route to raising performance is to offload computation to the game server. This will be done as a last-resort basis as more computation will cause scalability and cost efficency issues in production. James Knight has worked on these types of spatially distributed game servers at 3 seperate MMO development companies over his career, and is competent in being able to architect and implement them. 📦 Orchestration . Kubernetes will serve as the orchestrator for all the game servers and in-house developed auxillary services. Kubernetes was chosen as it allows for ease of deployment to any cloud provider (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, …) and reduces the need for cloud services during the development period as each developer can run a Kubernetes cluser on their local machine via Docker Desktop. Kubernetes supports auto-scaling, with strong integration with all major cloud providers, which will be highly leveraged during the live operation of the game to converse expenditure and scale up to support a spontaneous influx in players. 🐕‍🦺 Auxillary Services . The game will require a set of services which are readily provided by existing game service providers (Epic Games, Unity, …) or cloud providers. These services will ideally be leveraged rather than built in-house, to reduce development costs. Such services include: . | Authentication | Authorization | User account persistence | Game session statistics persistence | Configuration | Analytics | Payment processing | Version control | Artifact distribution | CI/CD pipeline | . 🖼️ Content Delivery . The game client will be delivered using the common mechanisms for delivering websites, using a CDN at the edge. This client will contain the most common and required assets (Models, textures, …). To reduce the size of the initial client download, most assets will be downloaded on demand as required. These will be delivered using a seperate CDN optimized for streaming on-demand binary assets. ☁️ Hosting . The backend will be distributed amongst atleast one cloud provider, potentially one for the kubernetes deployment and atleast one for the auxillary services. AWS is the likely candidate as their costing structure seems to be most efficent for this project, and they are providing free credits and support to this project through the Australian Games Tech group.

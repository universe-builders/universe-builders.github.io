### Overview


**Void Survivors**\* is a web-based free-to-play cooperative swarm-defense massively-multiplayer game, where hundreds of players group together to survive for as long as possible against increasingly difficult waves of nightmare invaders.

**Void Survivors** reimagines the mega-popular single-player ‘survivors’ genre into a massively-multiplayer format with cooperative mechanics and with deep Twitch integrations for streamers to play with their live audience. 

The game is currently in pre-production and solely being developed by Universe Builders, who are currently seeking funding to be able to complete a multiplayer prototype.

### Roguelite
Void Survivors has many random elements which make it a rogue-like in nature. Specifically:
* The sanctuary🌱 randomly grows fauna, forming the 'level' in which to defend.
* The player is provided with a set of 3 random abilities to choose from after successfully defending against a wave of enemies.
* The type of invaders👹 that are spawned are randomly chosen and are designed to be complementary to each other, causing a large variation of combinations. Each wave provides different and more challenging invaders.

## Survivors-Like
Void Survivors takes a lot of gameplay inspiration from the 2022 indie megahit 'Vampire Survivors' and the dozens of Survivors-Like games that have been released since, such as Soulstone Survivors and Brotato.

Survivors-Like combines two sub-genres, Bullet-Heaven and Swarm-Defense.

## Bullet-Heaven
Void Survivors uses the main mechanics from the relatively new genre of 'Bullet-Heaven'. Bullet-Hell games are an old genre dating back to arcade titles where the player has to dodge patterns of incoming projectiles. Bullet-Heaven reverses this and the player is the source of a huge amount of projectiles which seek to destroy enemies. Players strive to make effecient patterns of attacks that defeat incoming invaders with all sorts of properties, such as large numbers, high health, and small collision regions. Bullet-Heaven games typically use Swarm-Defense mechanics.

## Swarm-Defense
Void Survivors has players defend their sanctuary from waves of hundreds of invaders. Invaders spawn together in large swarms of simplistic intelligence, similar to what you'd expect of a zombie horde, with a variety of harder more dangerous individualistic invaders which has players deploy tactics to defeat those.

## 🪘 Design Pillars 🪘

These pillars help drive decisions in all aspects of the design direction and decisions.

## 🏃 Player Motivations 🏃
Void Survivors targets players with the following motivations. The primary motivations take precedence in all decision making and secondary motivations are supported to allow for a broader audience appeal.

### 🤝 Cooperation
Players are highly motivated to join as a community, to seek each other out, and to team up. Players progress faster in groups and are able to directly help each other using abilities. The game is optimally played with a pre-existing community, but solo players can join any team with no restrictions.

### 🏆 Competition
Teams will have statistics📊 of individual performance (damage, healing, ...) displayed at all times which will motivate competitive players to top the team leaderboard. This allows shareable moments within communities.

### 🔥 Destruction
The combat will cause over the top destruction (explosions, mayhem) to the environment and entities within, in a fireworks-display-esque comical manner. It should be suprising, enjoyable, and candy for your eyes.

### 😮 Excitement
The game will be fast paced, ramping up quickly until a point of overwhelming the player. It will be full of surprises and intense moments, eg when massive waves of enemies or specifically threatening enemies spawn "There's a dragon!!! Watch out everyone!!". Players should walk away from a 15 minute session feeling thrilled.

![Player Motivations](images/player-motivations-1.png)
[Source: Quantic Foundry](https://quanticfoundry.com/#motivation-model)

The choices for these primary motivations were informed by player psychology research conducted by [Quantic Foundry](https://quanticfoundry.com/), which provides a framework to relate player motivations. Specifically Coopereration🤝, Competition🏆, and Destruction🔥 motivations are all highly correlated - meaning a player motivated with one is highly likely to be motivated by the others.

### 💪 Secondary: Power
In a 15 minute session players will rapidly progress in their class by obtaining abilities. In the metagame players can upgrade and empower their class by expending earned currency.

### 🏆 Secondary: Completion
Players will be able to unlock a variety of achievements based on personal performance in their team and through progression in their classes. The list of achievements will be publicly available so that players can strive for them. Players can also pay to unlock various outfits and seasonal items which will appeal to completionists, See [Monetization Plan](monetization-plan) for more info.

### 🔎 Secondary: Discovery
Players will be able to discover a variety of unique and different environments, classes, achievements, and enemies over their sessions.

### ✍️ Secondary: Design
Players will be able to customize their characters using meta game progression and through in-app purchases as part of the monetization strategy. See [Monetization Plan](monetization-plan) for more info.

![Player Motivations](images/player-motivations-2.png)
[Source: Quantic Foundry](https://quanticfoundry.com/#motivation-model)

### 🙅‍♂️ Motivations not focused on

The game will **not** focus on the following player motivations:
* **Challenge**: The game will not focus on challenging mechanics as this would provide incentive for segregating teams based on competency or teams to exclude members based on skill level. There will be some challenge and mastery to the game, however random chance and random team compositions will make individual mastery less important than other game elements.

* **Strategy**: The game will not promote or require strategic thinking, at most some classes do require short term tactical thinking, and players can choose abilities tactically based on other players' choices. Random spawns of enemies will nullify any long term strategy, and promote short term dynamic reactivity. Strategic thinking opposes the short play session length and communication mechanisms that the game is designed around.

* **Fantasy/Story**: The game will not focus on allowing roleplaying of characters, nor will it invest highly in level design with rich dynamic storytelling, or in portraying a deep story through use of characters. The game a strong atmospheric theme and the stories generated in the game should be emergent and created, shared, and told by communities as opposed to being told to players through the game.

## 💭 Player Fantasies
These are fantasies that attract the player to Void Survivors and continues to motivate them to play.

* I want to play with large groups of players (100+).
* I want to feel impactful role within a group.
* I want to play with my friends.
* I want to play with my communities (gaming, social, work, ...).
* I want to play with popular streamers.

---

## 🛠️ Mechanics 🛠️
These are the mechanics, ie actions and tools, that the player will be able to use within the game.

### 🧭 2D Movement
Players can move around the world in the horizontal plane, ie unable to jump or move vertically.

### 🗡️ Auto Attacks
Characters will attack the nearest threat automatically, players need not aim attacks or choose targets. This is a characteristic mechanic of the bullet-heaven genre.

### 🔥 Character classes have unique abilities
Each character class has unique abilities that can be used to directly help team mates. For example:\
🛡️ Paladin: Block and reflect attacks.\
🦎 Tamer: Can tame invaders into friendly pets.\
🌷 Druid: Can grow defensive fauna.

### ⚠️ Telegraphed abilities and attacks
All abilities and attacks, from friends or enemies, will be telegraphed to allow the players to react to it. Players are able to get out of the way of enemy attacks and ensure they take advantage of any team mates abilities (eg a heal).

### 💪 Rapid Progression and ability unlocks
At the start of each session, a character has only the default abilities and gains new abilities rapidly over a 15 minute session. Each minute or so, chosen from a set of three random abilities. Players of each class will be given the same ability choices, and will see the abilities other players choose, so they can tactically to choose the same abilities or have a mixture of abilities on the team.

### 🙏 Stacked abilities
When a player uses an ability, such as an area based heal, other players will have the opportunity to stack their ability on top of it. This allows for stronger abilities that are only possible with numerous collaborating team mates. For example, an area based heal that has numerous stacks will have a wider area of effect and healing potency.

These mechanics reinforce

* Spawning life everywhere the player treds and it grows as they stay in one area
* Leader is larger and more powerful proportional to their team size
  * Neuroticism for streamers
* Statues for tracking progression
*

## 🎯 Players' Goal 🎯
During a session the players'🧙 goal is to gain as much life essence🌿 as possible. Life essence allows their character to level up💪, and is used to unlock character buffs in the metagame. The longer the player is able to defend the sanctuary🌱, the more life essence is gained.

Players are able to last longer by:
1. Finding players🧙 to team up which adds more defenders🛡️ to the sanctuary🌱. Players can find other players by joining an existing team, by inviting them via a link🔗, or by finding them in the void.
2. Gathering life essence🌿 from the sanctuary efficently by collecting it between waves of invaders and by living longer by avoiding taking damage💖 from invaders👹.
3. Starting stronger💪 by upgrading character classes in the metagame using gained life essence🌿.

----

## 🗺️ Level Design

The world is a giant void, a barren dark and misty landscape, filled with the shadowy remains of previously defeated players. There are no definable landmarks or areas that provide uniqueness, instead that comes about during the growth of the sanctuary. The void has little level design and content requirements.

![Void thematic art](images/8b355f808337f941abc447ecdab6cf61.jpg)
[Source: World Anvil](https://www.worldanvil.com)

The sanctuary will dynamically grow the longer it lasts which will spawn all sorts of obstacles in the form of fauna which the players can use to their advantage when fighting invaders. These obstacles will be procedurally spawned based on a small set of rules.

In all, Void Survivors has very little in terms of level design instead opting for large open spaces - which is common for bullet-heaven games.

## Overview

This document contains the funding opportunities and finance plan for Void Survivors. Contained are two budgets, an optimistic budget based on the ability to receive funding for all milestones at the current scope, and a budget based on a reduced game scope.

----

## Grant Funding Opportunities

This project is eligible for grants from various organizations. Including the following:
* Screen Australia Games Expansion: up to $150K
* Screen Victoria Digital Games: up to $500K
* Creative Victoria Creators Fund: $39K
* Australia Council Arts Projects: $41K

**The Creative Victoria Creators Fund has been applied for**, with aspirations to fund R&D activities which will form the technologies for the game client, and will reduce the cost for the project by ~$30K.

**The Australia Council Arts Project had been applied for**, with aspirations to fund creative exploration in social game design mechanics that pertain to this project, and will reduce the cost for the project by ~$35K.

**The Screen Australia Games Expansion Fund has been applied for**, with aspirations that it could provide $150K in funding, which will allow a far easier application to Screen Victoria and will provide funding up until the Alpha milestone.

**The Screen Victoria Digital Games Fund has been applied for**, with aspirations that it could initially provide funding for the Pre-Production milestone. It will be applied for again to aspirationally fund a further milestone.

## Publisher Funding Opportunities

Void Survivors is an attractive game for publishers due it's relatively low development and live operations cost, and it's opportunity to go viral.

There are dozens of appropriate publishers for Void Survivors. The best fit is web platform publishers, as they are reportedly underserviced. Publishers such as Armor Games and Kongregate frequently publish games that are distributed by their platform, usually with an exclusivity period.

It would be ideal to approach a publisher once the Alpha milestone has been achieved, which results in a vertical slice deliverable, as this would make the pitch more tangible.

----

## VC Funding Opportunities

Void Survivors is the first title from Universe Builders and it's development will result in a new game IP and core technology IP.

The core technology provides a unique resource for the company, which allows a solid market position which will be hard to be replaced by new titles without significant technology investment by them.

Further, the core technology allows the company to produce future titles similar to Void Survivors at a cheaper development cost. Having this technology makes Universe Builders more attractive to VC funding.

Universe Builders could receive VC funding for the purposes of completing Void Survivors, however it is the least attractive funding option due to the cost of acquiring the capital.

It would be ideal to approach VC funding once the Pre-Production milestone has been achieved, when the core technology has been tested and is proven.

----

## Crowd Funding Opportunities
Void Survivors is a social game which intends to appeal to communities of gamers and influential community managers. It could have a strong crowd funding presence if those groups could be convinced to invest.

This is not an ideal option due to the cost of preparing for and running the crowd funding campaign. It will not be considered unless all other funding options have not come to fruition.

----

## Finance Plan

To fund the development and production of Void Survivors, financing will be seeked out in the following order:
1. **Grant Funding** for exploration and R&D activities which will reduce the cost of Pre-Production.
2. **Grant Funding** for Pre-Production and Alpha milestones, and ideally Beta and Release.
3. **Publisher Funding**, ideally once Alpha has been completed and only if Grant Funding does not cover all milestones.
4. **VC Funding**/**Crowd Funding**, ideally once Pre-Production has been completed and only in the case that the above funding sources are unable to fund Void Survivors to completion.

----

## Contingencies

The following are contingencies in the case that the optimistic funding is not reached.

### Early Access
The Beta milestone will result in a horizontal slice which is monetizable and will support a large number of players. This is a great candidate for early access through Steam and other appropriate platforms, which can result in funding for the game and enable the delivery the Release milestone.

### Reduced Scope
A large cost center for the game is the Game Developer and Artist roles. By reducing the scope of the content in the game by ~50% the cost of development would decrease by ~35%.

This content could instead be developed in early access or live service, instead of in the Alpha and Beta milestones, based on funding received from monetizing the game.

This contingency has been budgeted below.

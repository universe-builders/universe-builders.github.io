## Release Strategy

Our release strategy is focused on leveraging several partners, marketplaces and systems to our advantage. The biggest advantage we can create is getting placement on the ‚ÄúNew and Trending‚Äù page of Steam. According to different sources this will give us access to about 1,900,000 impressions. 

The second biggest point of leverage is getting access to streamers and having them play Void Survivors with their community. The amount of leverage this will provide us will compound greatly ideally to a point of virality. A source of inspiration to simulate is the success of Among Us.

The third biggest point of leverage, is other peoples communities to build our own. This will come in the form of building our own community by providing playtests, valuable content, and appearances on other peoples channels.

## Tactical strategy for launch

The launch strategy is going to be broken up into 4 parts.

1. The Community.
2. Relationship Building.
3. Pre-release.
4. Release.

----

### The Community 

We are going to build our own community through Discord. Our community is going to be primarily focused on our game, sharing experiences, updates, builds, and playtests. Our objective is to have a similar and strong community like Dark and Darker and Ashes of Creation. 

We are also going to work with various media such as podcasts like Giant Bomb Cast, Game Scoop and Get Played to gain access to their communities. Further we will engage with discord groups, subreddits, and YouTube channels to increase exposure to our game.

### Relationship Building 

During the development of our game we are going to prioritize relationships with streamers, aligned companies, and content creators. 

We aren‚Äôt going to pitch our game, but instead build relationships with the key figures behind these potential partnerships. The idea is to build a relationship, provide value to them, help them with any issue they are experiencing and then when the time comes to release the game we will ask for their help in promoting it and pre-promoting it. 

The goal is to build relationships with streamers, help them, and in exchange they can give us the exposure needed to hit the new and trending tab. 

This same tactic will apply to aligned companies like Stream Labs, Stream Legends and similar companies (one email from any of these companies promoting our game will be game changing). 

### Pre-release 

60 days before the release of the game we are going to hype up our community, talk to our partners and organize promotions with all partners. 

Our goal during this stage is to get wishlists on Steam and to get people engaging with the store page before we go live. It is highly correlated that wishlists results in higher likelyhood on being on the new and trending (as well as providing pre-orders).

### Release

We are going to get our partners to promote the game on launch day and we are going to host a challenge for all partners and their communities. 

On launch day we will host a challenge of who can survive the longest will win a cash prize of $1,000. Our target for this promotion will be smaller streamers with under 500 views. 

To promote this challenge we are going to follow 3 tactics: 

1. Get all of our partners who helped with pre-release an early access key for them and their community. 
2. Three days before the release we are going to approach streamers who meet our criteria and approach them in two different ways, one will be an email from us providing them an early access key, the second way will be to donate to their streams notifying them of the challenge. This is inspired by the following successful campaigns by Ludwig. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip2trao6dYw&pp=ygUQbHVkd2lnIG9tZWdhbHVsIA%3D%3D and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7ufQ5Sz-no).
3. We are going to open our discord for pre-registers for the challenge, this will allow us to build hype and competitiveness with the community.

### Summary

With all of these strategies combined we are confident that to reach the "New and Trending" tab on Steam. This will also provide us exposure that is ideally creating positive feedback loops that leads towards virality.

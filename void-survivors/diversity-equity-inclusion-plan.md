## Introduction
Void Survivors is a game built for hyper-accessibility across cultures, individuals with accessibility requirements and preferences, social status, and for a range of different communities. We strive to develop a game that is inclusive to all people and never provides a reason for an individual to be excluded or segregated.

Like in the game we intend to build, the development of Void Survivors is committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment where anyone is able to contribute and thrive. Our culture is welcoming to differences and approaches from all people with kindness, respect, and inclusivity.

As developers on Void Survivors we aspire to:
* Treat everyone fairly.
* Encourage and ensure everyone has a voice.
* Respect everyone's freedom of thought and ideas.

## Diversity and Inclusion pillars
Our Diversity and Inclusion plan supports a working culture which is representative of Australia and a player culture which is representative of our world.

The following pillars are used to guide our culture:
1. Gender Equality.
2. First nations inclusion.
3. Inclusion of individuals with movement, vision, and cognitive impairments.
4. LGBTQIA+ support and celebration.
5. All abilities and ages.
6. Belief, culture, and communication diversity inclusion.

## Our Commitments
To guide Void Survivors on being as inclusive and accessible to players as possible, we've outlined our accessibility targets in the [Accessibility Plan](accessibility-plan).

We are committed to a diverse team and will promote hiring of applicants from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds, underrepresented groups, women and members of the LGBTQIA+ community. All hiring communications should include this statement.

To account for hidden biases, application materials should have as much identifiable information as possible removed prior to consideration.

To ensure that no pay discrepancies occur based on discrimination, all roles will have a standard pay rate and all developers will have a plan to progress in the levels of each role. All developers will know each other's roles and levels.

All developers will have access to anonymous and direct feedback mechanisms which are mediated by HR, externally or internally.

All developers are offered the option to have communications be mediated by an external party at the developers choosing, and compensated by the company.

All developers are offered diversity, inclusion, and communication skill training.

All developer complaints or feedback will be made available to the developer and reviewed by an external HR.

Void Survivors runs on numerous devices without any restriction of cross playing between them. The design of Void Survivors strongly considered how to present a game that feels like a native experience regardless of whether you are playing on a touch interface mobile device, on a laptop with a keypad, or on a desktop with a gamepad. The design process included excluding mechanics that wouldn’t be accessible on certain devices, such as precise targetting mechanics on touch devices, and distilling the UI to be appropriate on large and small screens. The choice of technologies ensured that we are able to successfully produce a game that can run effectively on a large set of devices and inputs, specifically by choosing Web as the target platform and investing in custom technology to optimize for it. The devices that Void Survivors will be avilable on are MacOSX, Linux, Windows, iPhone, and Android. ",

To support low-powered devices (low CPU, GPU, and battery life) common in low socio-economic environments it is vital to make the game as efficent as possible on those devices. This was a strong consideration in the choosing of the game genre and mechanics, eg: . | the art style is a highly-optimizable voxel representation, ideal for small GPUs | the physics is simplistic with little collision resolution, ideal for small CPUs | the AI is simplistic with behaviors able to be reused for numerous agents in the group, ideal for small CPUs | the inputs are minimal are work well on small and large screens, and using touch, gamepad, or keyboard | . The choice to invest in developing a custom engine provides ultimate control over the ability to optimize and deliver the best experience for low-powered devices, at the cost of a longer development cycle.

The game was designed in a way to be playable with minimal inputs, including using just one finger tapping or holding for mobile devices, as some movement impairments disallow tapping or holding a control for extended periods. Different control schemes will be offered, and are appropriate, for the game including click-to-move and hold-to-move, where hold-to-move is often problematic for those with hand movement impairments.

However most games require large downloads before being able to play the game, and typical engines perpetuate this problem by offering little support to streaming assets and minimizing build sizes. Void Survivors will require no installation, by the nature of the Web, and the initial download size will be optimized to package the bare minimum assets, in a highly compressed format, and further assets will be streamed in on demand. Assets will be offered in various definitions - allowing users to specify downloading standard-definition assets or high-definition assets based on their requirements.

Most games usually use TCP-based networking transport or a connection based UDP networking transport, which are both very intolerant of network jitter and only support those players with high connectivity and a consistent connection. These players have been supported in Void Survivors, by choosing a connectionless UDP-based networking transport which is highly tolerant of dropped and corrupted data. Further, a peer-to-peer networking topology will be leveraged, using WebRTC, which allows for players to connect directly to other players, instead of having to be routed through a server that may be geographically distant from them. These approaches allow for a highly tolerant networking environment where users can lose connectivity for extended periods of time without being removed or disconnected from a session, and allows for lower latency and better experience for players in remote areas.

Universe Builders strives to make games that have no exclusionary or segregation mechanics to allow a large range of skill levels and player motivations access to our games. The foremost way that Void Survivors allows players of different skill levels and motivations to play together is by offering a range of character classes that have different play styles and skill level requirements. For example the Healer class can be played with low skill level and in a purely team support way, as they are motivated away from combat and towards groups of players. This class is ideal for players that do not want to engage in the stress of combat and for low-skill players. In contrast the Rogue class is recommended to have high skill level and for players wanting an action oriented combat experience, as it requires environmental awareness, is combat focused, and to play effectively requires strategic risk taking. Having this wide range of skill level accessibility means that players can choose a class that suits them at a particular point in time, and allows players with little experience to be impactful and valuable to a team.

Void Survivors should support as many people as possible, on as many devices as possible, in as many situations as possible. 🔓 Accessible graphics that are clear and understandable at a glance. 🔓 Low hardware requirements (Older phones, laptops, …). 🔓 Consideration for individuals with visual impairments. 🔓 Low download requirements for low bandwidth tolerance. 🔓 Streamable assets for downloading on demand. 🔓 The graphics should be appropriate for players PG+. 🔥 Destruction . Void Survivors has a primary player motivation for destruction, ie explosions, flashy visual effects, objects being smashed apart, and general mayhem. 🎆 All objects should be destructable and breakable, in a performant manner. 🎆 Particle effects and other VFX should be highly leveraged. 📍 Low Fidelity . The simulation of Void Survivors is lower fidelity than many action titles, specifically by using simpler physics🎾 (collision and resolution) and artificial intelligence🧠 than most action titles. This is to allow performant computation on low-end hardware and allows for large swarms of enemies and players in a single team. The art style should reinforce this this. As detailed in the ‘Kingdoms and Castles’ postmortem, players expect higher fidelity simulation the higher fidelity the graphics are. Kingdoms and Castles chose a very low-fidelity art style to match their low-fidelity simulation, and received critical and commercial success. Kingdoms and castles postmorem (GDC Vault) . 🐲 Fantastical . Void Survivors is set in an environment that is whimsical and light hearted. It avoids heavy themes, horror elements, and realism. Players should get a sense of wonder and delight in the environment and elements within Void Survivors. The combat will be highly stylized and not use gore, blood, or any other violent themes. 🧚 Effects should be comical and highly animated. 🧚 Themes should be vibrant. 🧚 Invaders should be based in fantasy and myth.

    "title": "🏃 Player Motivations 🏃",
    "content": "Void Survivors targets players with the following motivations. The primary motivations take precedence in all decision making and secondary motivations are supported to allow for a broader audience appeal. 🤝 Cooperation . Players are highly motivated to join as a community, to seek each other out, and to team up. Players progress faster in groups and are able to directly help each other using abilities. The game is optimally played with a pre-existing community, but solo players can join any team with no restrictions. 🏆 Competition . Teams will have statistics📊 of individual performance (damage, healing, …) displayed at all times which will motivate competitive players to top the team leaderboard. This allows shareable moments within communities. 🔥 Destruction . The combat will cause over the top destruction (explosions, mayhem) to the environment and entities within, in a fireworks-display-esque comical manner. It should be suprising, enjoyable, and candy for your eyes. 😮 Excitement . The game will be fast paced, ramping up quickly until a point of overwhelming the player. It will be full of surprises and intense moments, eg when massive waves of enemies or specifically threatening enemies spawn “There’s a dragon!!! Watch out everyone!!”. Players should walk away from a 15 minute session feeling thrilled. Source: Quantic Foundry . These choices were informed by player psychology research conducted by Quantic Foundry, which provides a framework to relate player motivations to each other. Specifically Coopereration🤝, Competition🏆, and Destruction🔥 motivations are all highly correlated - meaning a player motivated with one is highly likely to be motivated by the others. 💪 Secondary: Power . In a 15 minute session players will rapidly progress in their class by obtaining abilities. In the metagame players can upgrade and empower their class by expending earned currency. 🏆 Secondary: Completion . Players will be able to unlock a variety of achievements based on personal performance in their team and through progression in their classes. The list of achievements will be publicly available so that players can strive for them. Players can also pay to unlock various outfits and seasonal items which will appeal to completionists, See Monetization Plan for more info. 🔎 Secondary: Discovery . Players will be able to discover a variety of unique and different environments, classes, achievements, and enemies over their sessions. ✍️ Secondary: Design . Players will be able to customize their characters using meta game progression and through in-app purchases as part of the monetization strategy. See Monetization Plan for more info. Source: Quantic Foundry . The game will not be focused on the following player motivations: . | Challenge: The game will not focus on challenging mechanics as this would provide incentive for segregating teams based on competency or teams to exclude members based on skill level. There will be some challenge and mastery to the game, however random chance and random team compositions will make individual mastery less important than other game elements. | Strategy: The game will not promote or require strategic thinking, at most some classes do require short term tactical thinking, and players can choose abilities tactically based on other players’ choices. Random spawns of enemies will nullify any long term strategy, and promote short term dynamic reactivity. Strategic thinking opposes the short play session length and communication mechanisms that the game is designed around. | Fantasy/Story: The game will not focus on allowing roleplaying of characters, nor will it invest highly in level design with rich dynamic storytelling, or in portraying a deep story through use of characters. The game has a story and a theme but the stories generated in the game should be emergent and be stories created, shared, and treasured by communities as opposed to being told to players through the game. | .

Players can move around the world in the horizontal plane, ie unable to jump or move vertically. 🗡️ Auto Attacks . Characters will attack the nearest threat automatically, players need not aim attacks or choose targets. This is a characteristic mechanic of the bullet-heaven genre. 🔥 Character classes have unique abilities . Each character class has unique abilities that can be used to directly help team mates. For example: 🛡️ Paladin: Block and reflect attacks. 🦎 Tamer: Can tame invaders into friendly pets. 🌷 Druid: Can grow defensive fauna. ⚠️ Telegraphed abilities and attacks . All abilities and attacks, from friends or enemies, will be telegraphed to allow the players to react to it. Players are able to get out of the way of enemy attacks and ensure they take advantage of any team mates abilities (eg a heal). 💪 Rapid Progression and ability unlocks . At the start of each session, a character has only the default abilities and gains new abilities rapidly over a 15 minute session. Each minute or so, chosen from a set of three random abilities. Players of each class will be given the same ability choices, and will see the abilities other players choose, so they can tactically to choose the same abilities or have a mixture of abilities on the team. 🙏 Stacked abilities . When a player uses an ability, such as an area based heal, other players will have the opportunity to stack their ability on top of it. This allows for stronger abilities that are only possible with numerous collaborating team mates. For example, an area based heal that has numerous stacks will have a wider area of effect and healing potency.

It is paired with three sub-genres which are undersupplied (Roguelite, Bullet-Heaven, Swarm-Defense), and one sub-genre that is oversupplied (Action). There is concern with action games being the third most popular genre on Steam as it may be hard to differentiate in that competitive market, especially when a lot of the game-loop of Void Survivors revolves around action. Action however is the largest market size of all the genre’s of Void Survivors meaning the demand is high for the genre. Hack and slash, dungeon crawlers, and roguelikes all have a low average price compared to other genres (~$11.50). This may be an advantage as Void Survivors is a free-to-play game and players of these genre’s expect to pay relatively low for those genres, but may be an indicator that players are willing to spend less and convert less into paying players.

Classes will reach a maximum progression and player’s can extend their progression in the game by purchasing new classes. This provides three motivations for the player to purchase a class: . | Increases survivability due to having more utility. | Increases value to team due to being able to change to class that the team is lacking. | Increased progression in the game. | . As the game is supported new classes will be released. This is a common monetization strategy in games that have numerous characters or character classes, including RPGs and fighting games. Games that have used this strategy successfully include: . | League of Legends | Multiversus | Rainbow six siege | . This strategy allows for integration into subscription services, eg Xbox’s Games Pass, where players on the subscription will have all classes unlocked whilst they play the game through that services interface.

The game should support as many people as possible, on as many devices as possible, in as many situations as possible. 🔓 Low download requirements for low bandwidth tolerance. 🔓 Highly device and OS accessible (Win, Mac, Linux, iPhone, Android). 🔓 Low hardware requirements (Older phones, laptops, …). 🔓 Low bandwidth and connectivity common on public transport or remote areas. ✨ High Content Density . The game client should support a high density of players and content on screen. ⭐ Up to hundreds of players on screen at one time. ⭐ Lots of abilities. ⭐ Lots of invaders. ⭐ Lots of particle and destruction effects. 🎪 Massively Scalable . The game world should support a large amount of varied size teams from small to large and for large amounts of players joining the game spontaneously. 🔺 All teams should be placed within the same world, allowing players to discover them by exploring the void. 🔺 Support for scaling up game servers to support a large community joining within seconds. 🔺 Support for scaling down game servers to conserve hosting expenditure.

    "title": "🖥️🎮 Game Client Technology Stack",
    "content": "🌐 Web Browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, …) . Web browsers were chosen because they are available on all major platforms, including desktops, laptops, mobile phones, and even smart TV’s. It is the easiest way to make the game device inclusive. Web browsers have reached a maturity with their graphics fidelity (WebGL/WebGPU), their runtime performance (WASM), and their networking capabilities (WebRTC), to ensure that a low-fidelity game can be developed and run at a high-fps. Web applications can be packaged into native applications for PC, Mac, and mobile phones using progressive-web app technologies such as Electron. If the game wishes to leverage the hardware acceleration and API advantages of a native application, this route is a proven option. ✨ Simulation Architecture . The simulation architecture used will be an Entity-Component-System architecture using Data-Oriented principles to optimize performance for a large amount of unique entities on screen. This style of architecture has been popularized by Unity’s ECS implementation and has a proven ability to allow low-end hardware to support thousands of unique objects being simulated at high frame rates. 👾 Graphics . WebGL is the graphics library that will be targeted until WebGPU has reached mass availability, as currently it is only available in Chrome browsers. The graphics interface will be developed in-house, interfacing with WebGL directly, opposed to using an existing interface such as BabylonJS or ThreeJS. This was chosen as the graphical optimizations that can be realized for a voxel based graphical style outweigh the development cost of building this interface. Our team has previous expertise in developing such interfaces. Lot’s of the characters, enemies, and effects will be the same which will allow for instancing on the GPU to provide better frame rates for low end devices. 🎾 Physics . The physics in the game will be low-fidelity to reduce performance load on low-powered devices as the amount of collidable elements (players, invaders, …) will be high. The results of colliding with an enemy will not result in a physical reaction, such as being pushed back, but will result in damage taken. This results in far less computation required and thus supports lower-end hardware and is the typical behavior in bullet-heaven game. 🏃‍♀️ Animation . The animation in the game will be simple interpolation of key frames without using skeletal, procedural, or computationally expensive systems such as Inverse-Kinematics. This results in a far simpler to produce animations, less computation expensive animation system, and less bandwidth required to transmit animated assets. 🧠 Artificial intelligence . The AI in the game will be simplistic to reduce performance load on low-powered devices as the amount of intelligent simulated agents (invaders) will be high. Invaders will be simulated using a simplistic finite state machine as it is highly performant, compared to that of behavior tree or more complicated GOAP graph, and will use simplistic steering behaviors (flocking, avoidance, interception, …) to create more sophisticated grouping behaviors. 🖧 Networking . WebRTC data channels will be used for the bulk of game communications as they are UDP based and ideal for low-latency low-bandwidth operations and allow for peer-to-peer connections at ~70% success rate for NAT punchthrough. It also removes the need for persistent connections which can be inconsistent on public transport and in low bandwidth environments, such as those in low socioeconomic areas. WebSockets will be used for communicating to content providers and other backend providers that do not require low latency, for usages such as streaming in required assets to play the game. HTTP REST requests will be used for communication to various API’s, such as authentication. 🖳 Language . WebAssembly will be the language that will run on each player’s device through the Web Browser. The team will use the C language to write logic which will then be transpiled into WebAssembly via the clang toolchain. The client engine is seperated into independent modules which include the core runtime engine and the game systems. Each game system is independently built and linked which allows for a quick iteration and runtime hot reloading when developing logic for a single system, opposed to needing build and reload the entire game. ❓ Why not use a pre-existing engine? . There are many engines that export a builds to the web, such as Unity, UE4, and Godot, however all of those options fail to hit several of the technical requirements that this game desires. Specifically all of those engines struggle to export Web builds that run well on low-end hardware, even struggling to hit high frame rates on average gaming machines, and deliver game builds and assets that result in large initial downloads for users. Due to this these reasons, thse engines are a poor choice for meeting our accessibility goals. Further, getting those engines to support the high content density desired, in web exports, is a development challenge. There are engines specifically for developing web based games, such as BabylonJS and PlayCanvas, however those provide no feature support for the networking and high content density requirements for the game, and the advantages of each engine were not deemed justifyable for the restrictions imposed for this specific project. These engine options were investigated in the ideation phase of this project. The Web platform and low simulation &amp; graphical fidelity requirements of this game means that building a custom engine provides the ability to optimize around these requirements. In tests done in the ideation phase it was validated that the fidelity bar could be hit using a simple custom engine on low powered devices, running at a frame rate that exceeded all other tested engines. There are numerous web based games that have chosen to invest in their own engine, including Krunker.io debatably the most played 3D multiplayer web game available, and no discovered examples of web based 3D multiplayer games with 30+ FPS that were developed using one of the aforementioned engines. The content generation pipelines will however use existing technologies, specifically MagicaVoxel for generating 3D assets, and the engine will integrate with those. Although the initial cost for developing this technology is high it means the product is positioned in a place where it is hard for substitutes or new entrants. See the Accessibility Plan for more information on how a custom engine allows us to achieve a more accessible and better experience for our players. ",

    "content": "🎮 Game Server . Game servers will handle all non-client side interactions and ensuring the consistency of the simulation for all players. The game client will have a lot of authority regarding what events take place, such as whether a player was inflicted by damage, and the game server will do some light validation of these events. This poses the risk of players cheating, however as a cooperative game this will not have the exploitation rewards compared to a competitive game. The game server will flag any clear invalidations of the game rules which may result in a player being banned. The game server will be written in the C language and executed as binaries in the Alpine Linux OS inside of a container. Similar to the game client, each game system will be a seperate container and orchestrated seperately allowing for quick iteration speed in development and rolling updates to specific systems in production. Game servers will have authority over a single team and will handle migrating new teams as teams merge or seperate. As new teams form game servers will be horizontally scaled to account for the new team. Game servers will be vertically scalable to account for a team changing in size dramatically, ie as a team grows in player numbers it will have more hardware resources available to it. Game servers will be spatially distributed to allow players exploring the void to enter and exit them through moving in the game world. Once target devices have been identified, during development performance tests will continously be run to ensure that the devices have consistent and high performance. One route to raising performance is to offload computation to the game server. This will be done as a last-resort basis as more computation will cause scalability and cost efficency issues in production. James Knight has worked on these types of spatially distributed game servers at 3 seperate MMO development companies over his career, and is competent in being able to architect and implement them. 📦 Orchestration . Kubernetes will serve as the orchestrator for all the game servers and in-house developed auxillary services. Kubernetes was chosen as it allows for ease of deployment to any cloud provider (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, …) and reduces the need for cloud services during the development period as each developer can run a Kubernetes cluser on their local machine via Docker Desktop. Kubernetes supports auto-scaling, with strong integration with all major cloud providers, which will be highly leveraged during the live operation of the game to converse expenditure and scale up to support a spontaneous influx in players. 🐕‍🦺 Auxillary Services . The game will require a set of services which are readily provided by existing game service providers (Epic Games, Unity, …) or cloud providers. These services will ideally be leveraged rather than built in-house, to reduce development costs. Such services include: . | Authentication | Authorization | User account persistence | Game session statistics persistence | Configuration | Analytics | Payment processing | Version control | Artifact distribution | CI/CD pipeline | . 🖼️ Content Delivery . The game client will be delivered using the common mechanisms for delivering websites, using a CDN at the edge. This client will contain the most common and required assets (Models, textures, …). To reduce the size of the initial client download, most assets will be downloaded on demand as required. These will be delivered using a seperate CDN optimized for streaming on-demand binary assets. ☁️ Hosting . The backend will be distributed amongst atleast one cloud provider, potentially one for the kubernetes deployment and atleast one for the auxillary services. AWS is the likely candidate as their costing structure seems to be most efficent for this project, and they are providing free credits and support to this project through the Australian Games Tech group.

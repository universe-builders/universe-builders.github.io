## High Level Marketing Strategy

Void Survivors allows players to join an existing game session by using a simple web browser link. The marketing strategy is entirely focused on engaging existing synchronous gaming communities to motivate players to join existing sessions, share their own session, and eventually have the community provide a permanant session link.

The strategy focuses on syncrhonous game communities, ie Discord and Twitch, as opposed to asychronous forums such as Reddit or Facebook, as the optimal way the game is discovered is via players joining a link to a live session.

To achieve this, the following strategies will be deployed:
* Engage existing Discord gaming communities.
* Foster a Discord gaming community and email list around the game.
* Sponsor game streamers to play sessions with their communities.

## Strategy: Engaging existing Discord gaming communities

This strategy is about acquiring new players through existing gaming communities.

To achieve this, the following steps will be undertaken:
1. Identify Discord gaming communities, join, and engage*.
2. Occasionally post a link to an existing session, looking for online community members to join.
3. Engage the community owners to post a permanant link to a session, this allows their community to be discovered by other players in game - increasing their community sizes.

*It's important to engage consistently and for a long period, as some communities have posting restrictions, which disallow new or inactive users from posting.

Examples of existing Discord gaming communities:
* Socializing : 169k members.
* Tribe Gaming : 90k members.
* Aura Gaming : 40k members.

This strategy is common in Reddit/Facebook forums, and it is very hard to cut through the noise without paid promotion. However this strategy is not common in synchronous communities as the lifetime of posts is very short. 

This strategy is modern, as over the last few years many online communities have moved from Facebook/Reddit to Discord.

This strategy focuses on the main user target, that of a person in a gaming community looking to play and interact with others in the community.

The final step of this strategy is for communities to post a permalink for Void Survivors in their community, this allows players in their community to join at any time and be placed with others in that community. The advantage for the community is ease of joining and the community can be discovered by other players within the game - allowing for people to organically discover and join the community. Other incentives such as affiliation percentages of purchases for community members, and in-game benifits such as life essence bonuses can be used.

This strategy requires no financial investment, only time investment in having accounts active and engaged in a number of gaming communities.

## Strategy: Foster a discord gaming community around the game

This strategy is about creating a centralized community in Discord for players to engage with the game, including finding existing sessions and players to play with, and the development of the game. The community will increase keep player retention through consistent updates and events.

The achieve this, the following steps will be undertaken:
1. Set up a Discord server under the games' name.
2. Provide a link to the Discord server in the game.
3. Set up group channels, allowing players to join active groups and join via their link.
4. Host events, such as double XP via specific links, 

Games have used this strategy to allow players to find teams to play with, specifically it has been used successfully by:
* GTFO
* Dark and Darker
* PUBG

Upon joining, players will be asked for their email address for infrequent communications about the game. This email list will be used to send an email ~1 time per month for events and game updates. This will increase player retention.

The community will have release updates, changelogs, for the game. This will be posted as a notification to draw interest from players, get them hyped for the update, and increase player retention.

The community will have opportunities for players to engage with developers and the development, through polls and channels that have direct communication with developers. This allows us to receive and react to player feedback.

This strategy requires no financial investment, only time investment in having accounts active and engaged in a number of gaming communities.

# Ideas
* Join a bunch of gaming communities and share a link to it
* Who is your project for?
* Psychographic segmentation -- venn diagram for game, middle is game, what contributes to the game
* What do they play?
* Where do they hangout?
* Choose a few targetted marketing streams (not dev diary)
* Launching on armor games, newgrounds, ...
* What communities exist?

* Later behavioral segmentation as analytics becomes available, able to target classes, teams.
  * Personalize
  * Segment based on behavior
  eg players acting efficently, competitively
  players acting socially

* Later demographic segmentation within the bounds of GDPR compliance

* Later geographic segmentation as analytics becomes available, able to target sales and skins.

? Can i gather psychgraphic information from existing communities
? Do the behaviors of those communities reinforce the behaviors I want
  * Sharing links
  * Cooperation
  * Competition

? What existing titles exist in the realm of twitch communities interacting with streamers

? Do the psychographics reinforce the player fantasies?
  * Do they want to play together?
  * Are the competitive?

* What are the interests of these people?

Reinforcement: They are already part of a community and thus cooperation, socialization are important to them

Reinforcement: Existing discord communities for dark and darker, gtfo, ...

* Is it a blue ocean, green ocean, ..?

* Create different personalities to market/design to?





Target: Existing communities

Self-Publishing: If you are adopting a self-publishing strategy name your key priorities. If you are new to this, make sure you test your ideas with experienced developers.

Platform engagement: What platforms are you targeting and what you are doing to actively engage with them for positioning on online markets if possible.

User Acquisition Strategies: Particularly if self-publishing.

Competitor/Previous Products: Listing competitor or previously released games shows that you have done market research. Avoid listing market leaders and breakout titles- if you are an indie dev, you can't compete with Doom or Mario! Check sites where you can get good information around sales figures and review performance. Remember console providers rarely make these figures public so be ready to compensate for that in your comparisons. Create a table and link or import the media.

* Create own community
    * GTFO
    * D&D

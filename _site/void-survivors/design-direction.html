Bullet-Hell games are an old genre dating back to arcade titles where the player has to dodge patterns of incoming projectiles. Bullet-Heaven reverses this and the player is the source of a huge amount of projectiles which seek to destroy enemies. Players strive to make effecient patterns of attacks that defeat incoming invaders with all sorts of properties, such as large numbers, high health, and small collision regions. Bullet-Heaven games typically use Swarm-Defense mechanics.</p> <p><img src="images/rotmg.jpg" alt="Realm of the mad god" /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdstRmn3Y50">Source: Youtube ‘Kalle Gaming’</a></p> <p>Games in this genre that inspire Void Survivors:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqyVr1zP2X8">Realm of the Mad God</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="swarm-defense"> <a href="#swarm-defense" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="swarm-defense"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Swarm-Defense </h2> <p>Void Survivors has players defend their sanctuary from waves of hundreds of invaders.

Random spawns of enemies will nullify any long term strategy, and promote short term dynamic reactivity. Strategic thinking opposes the short play session length and communication mechanisms that the game is designed around.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fantasy/Story</strong>: The game will not focus on allowing roleplaying of characters, nor will it invest highly in level design with rich dynamic storytelling, or in portraying a deep story through use of characters. The game a strong atmospheric theme and the stories generated in the game should be emergent and created, shared, and told by communities as opposed to being told to players through the game.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src="images/player-motivations-3.png" alt="Player Motivations" /> <a href="https://quanticfoundry.com/#motivation-model">Source: Quantic Foundry</a></p><hr /> <h2 id="-player-fantasies"> <a href="#-player-fantasies" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="-player-fantasies"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 💭 Player Fantasies </h2> <p>These are fantasies that attract the player to Void Survivors and continues to motivate them to play.</p> <ul> <li>I want to play with large groups of players (100+).</li> <li>I want to feel impactful role within a group.</li> <li>I want to play with my friends.</li> <li>I want to play with my communities (gaming, social, work, …).</li> <li>I want to play with popular streamers.</li> </ul><hr /> <h2 id="️-mechanics-️"> <a href="#️-mechanics-️" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="️-mechanics-️"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 🛠️ Mechanics 🛠️ </h2> <p>These are the mechanics, ie actions and tools, that the player will be able to use within the game.</p> <h3 id="-2d-movement"> <a href="#-2d-movement" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="-2d-movement"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 🧭 2D Movement </h3> <p>Players can move around the world in the horizontal plane, ie unable to jump or move vertically.</p> <h3 id="️-auto-attacks"> <a href="#️-auto-attacks" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="️-auto-attacks"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 🗡️ Auto Attacks </h3> <p>Characters will attack the nearest threat automatically, players need not aim attacks or choose targets.

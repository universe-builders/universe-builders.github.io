* Join a bunch of gaming communities and share a link to it
* Who is your project for?
* Psychographic segmentation -- venn diagram for game, middle is game, what contributes to the game
* What do they play?
* Where do they hangout?
* Choose a few targetted marketing streams (not dev diary)

Target: Existing communities

* Create own community
    * GTFO
    * D&D

# Testing

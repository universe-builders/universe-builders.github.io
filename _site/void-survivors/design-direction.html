as possible.</p> <p>🔓 Simplistic one touch (mobile) or one hand (keyboard/controller) controls.<br /> 🔓 Accessible graphics that are clear and understandable at a glance.<br /> 🔓 Low hardware requirements (Older phones, laptops, …).<br /> 🔓 Highly device and OS accessible (Win, Mac, Linux, iPhone, Android).<br /> 🔓 No segregating of players based on experience, skill, or any other factors.<br /> 🔓 Allow anyone to join any team at any time, no exclusionary mechanics. <br /> 🔓 No textual communications, instead use pictoral and graphical communications.<br /> 🔓 Modes of playing that allow low-skilled players and high-skilled players.<br /> 🔓 Modes of playing that allow for players to be support focused opposed to combat focused.<br /> 🔓 Low download requirements for low bandwidth tolerance.<br /> 🔓 Consideration for individuals with visual and movement impairments.</p> <h3 id="️-community-engageable"> <a href="#️-community-engageable" class="anchor-heading"

easily engage with it and allows them to strengthen bonds through shared experiences and stories.</p> <p>👪 Easily shareable via a link.<br /> 👪 Joining a session requires no authentication or personally identifying information. <br /> 👪 Joining immediately places you with the person who invited you. <br /> 👪 Able to join at any point in the session. <br /> 👪 Every extra player is a bonus, never a liability. <br /> 👪 Huge limit on the player count (100+), allowing for large communities. <br /> 👪 Shareable moments that can be distributed in the community. <br /> 👪 Cooperative driven

curve. <br /> 🥳 Multi-taskable, allowing people to have split attention while playing. <br /> 🥳 Themes and enemies that are whimsical and light fantasy. <br /> 🥳 No gratiuitous violence, sexual or mature content. <br /> 🥳 No overly complicated or devisive content. <br /> 🥳 Only positive reinforcement, never any punishments or penalties. <br /> 🥳 Allow people to disengage and re-engage at a whim

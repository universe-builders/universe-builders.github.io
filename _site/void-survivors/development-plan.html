Future versions of these roles will be open for contractors and the technology will be in a stable and documented state to allow ease of onboarding and development. At this phase there needs to be a lot of decisions around architecture which requires an experience programmer, which James Knight will fulfill.</p><hr /> <h3 id="️-pre-production-risks--mitigations-"> <a href="#️-pre-production-risks--mitigations-" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="️-pre-production-risks--mitigations-"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> ⚠️ Pre-Production: Risks &amp; Mitigations ✅ </h3> <p>⚠️ <strong>The ‘Game Developer’ role will be hard or expensive to source</strong><br /> The custom game engine uses technologies that are less common for game developers to possess. Specifically, Web based technologies are not common for game developers to have. Further, the use of the C language is infrequently used in games where C# (Unity) and C++ (Unreal Engine) are more common. Further, game developers are generally wary of joining companies with unique tech stacks due to the low transferability of skills to other employers.</p> <p>✅ Unreal Engine developers would fit better than Unity developers in C programming, as C++ (Unreal) is far closer in language to C than C# (Unity). When hiring, preference those with Unreal or C++ skills.<br /> ✅ The engine leverages numerous libraries that reduce the complexity of C, specifically by providing Data Structures and Algorithms that can be used out of the box.<br /> ✅ The engine is architected in a way that all of the logic touched by Game Developers will be in C, and no knowledge or understanding of Web technologies is required. Specifically shaders are in typical GLSL and all logic is transpiled into WebAssembly and run on the Web without any input required from the developer.<br /> ✅ Developers can be excited by new technologies, as they do not carry the legacy baggage that frustrates developers in the Unity and Unreal ecosystems. This could be a huge selling point when hiring.<br /> ✅ Developers looking to upskill in new technologies would fit well, this could be a selling point when hiring.</p> <p>⚠️ <strong>The programmer role is highly specialized and will be hard or expensive to source</strong><br /> The programmer role requires a bunch of specialized skills, specifically engine development, multiplayer knowledge, kubernetes expertise, …</p> <p>✅ James Knight will be undertaking this role for the duration of the project, and has 10+ years experience in developing such technologies.<br /> ✅ In future milestones, programmer contractors will have access to a more abstracted, stable, and documented technology - allowing for development without the expertise of those specialized skills.</p> <p>⚠️ <strong>Art will be too computationally or graphically expensive for target hardware</strong></p> <p>✅ As part of the refinement of the art direction the programmer should be included with respect to hypothesising and validating the performance of the art. This should be incorporated to the stress testing of the client. If the art is too expensive, then concessions must be made on the art or the minimum required hardware.</p> <p>⚠️ <strong>Asset pipelines are inoptimal leading to slow development iteration</strong> As the custom engine may not be optimal for the artist to integrate their work, test it out in the game engine renderer, and test it with gameplay – as the tooling may not exist or be immature.</p> <p>✅ The programmer will be working along side the artist to define and implement appropriate pipelines.<br /> ✅ The artist is able to continue work in isolation of their tool, MagicaVoxel, to implement the models and animations as it has in built support for the Isometric camera that will also be used within the game. Due to the simplistic level design, little consideration is needed with respect to composing models within a complicated scene.</p> <p>⚠️ <strong>Transitioning the game-genre into multiplayer requires extensive design iterations and testing</strong><br /> The Survivors-Like genre is mostly single-player, with only one game in the genre that supports two players. Because this genre has never been combined with MMO it may require a lot of work to get them to mesh together coherently.</p> <p>✅ To front load this risk, ideally before testing the vertical-slice, there will be a number of prototypes created in Unity to experiment with many of the least refined mechanics of the game.<br /> ✅ Whilst there are no Survivors-Like games, there are numerous games that are in the MMO space that contain similar gameplay mechanics which do work exceptionally well - such as Realm of the Mad God and certain dungeons in World of Warcraft. Taking inspiration from these titles provides a set of tools that is proven to work in this general genre.</p> <p>⚠️ <strong>James Knight has too many programming responsibilities to deliver the milestone on time</strong></p> <p>✅ The Tool Developer 🔨 role can be contracted out without much risk to expense. (See Opportunities below).<br /> ✅ The vertical slice has been defined to allow appropriately distributing programming work to other milestones.<br /> ✅ Contractors can be hired for specific tasks, such as creating the CI/CD pipeline.<br /> ✅ Time estimations include expectations that these roles will be undertaken by one person.</p><hr /> <h2 id="-pre-production-opportunities"> <a href="#-pre-production-opportunities" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="-pre-production-opportunities"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> ⭐ Pre-Production: Opportunities </h2> <p>✅ <strong>Web developers can be contracted for tooling 🔨</strong><br /> Most game development tool positions requires expertise that generally falls outside a typical game developer’s skill set, and are generally less attractive roles because they are supporting development opposed to working on the game directly.</p> <p>As the engine focuses on a Web based platform deployment, the editor will focus on the Web Browser as the native development tool. This opens up the ability to hire to web developers, of which the market is saturated with Web Developers and the cost of contracting a web developer is significantly lower than a typical Game Tool developer.</p> <p>Further, the Web has the richest ecosystem of tooling via pre-build packages than any other ecosystem (npm). These tools can be leveraged opposed to developing them directly, reducing the development timeline and increasing the quality of tooling.</p> <p>✅ <strong>Juniors can be contracted for prototyping</strong><br /> James Knight has been teaching Unity developers for 3+ years and has access to a wide network of junior level game developers.</p> <p>Due to the technology choices and requirements of the prototype, juniors are able to develop effectively and autonomously.</p> <p>✅ <strong>Leveraging James Knight’s specialization to produce a genre that is under supplied</strong><br /> As seen in the <a href="/market-research">market-research</a>, the genres of Void Survivors is under supplied, specifically in the MMO genre.</p> <p>James Knight has 8+ years working as an engineer, designer, and product manager for MMO game and technology development.

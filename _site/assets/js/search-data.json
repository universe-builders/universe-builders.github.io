    "content": "These pillars help drive decisions in all aspects of the game design. 🗝️ Hyper Accessible . The game should support as many people as possible, on as many devices as possible, in as many situations as possible. 🔓 Simplistic one touch (mobile) or one hand (keyboard/controller) controls. 🔓 Accessible graphics that are clear and understandable at a glance. 🔓 Low hardware requirements (Older phones, laptops, …). 🔓 Highly device and OS accessible (Win, Mac, Linux, iPhone, Android). 🔓 No segregating of players based on experience, skill, or any other factors. 🔓 Allow anyone to join any team at any time, no exclusionary mechanics. 🔓 No textual communications, instead use pictoral and graphical communications. 🔓 Modes of playing that allow low-skilled players and high-skilled players. 🔓 Modes of playing that allow for players to be support focused opposed to combat focused. 🔓 Low download requirements for low bandwidth tolerance. 🔓 Consideration for individuals with visual and movement impairments. 🏘️ Community Engageable . The game should allow communities to easily engage with it and allows them to strengthen bonds through shared experiences and stories. 👪 Easily shareable via a link. 👪 Joining a session requires no authentication or personally identifying information. 👪 Joining immediately places you with the person who invited you. 👪 Able to join at any point in the session. 👪 Every extra player is a bonus, never a liability. 👪 Huge limit on the player count (100+), allowing for large communities. 👪 Shareable moments that can be distributed in the community. 👪 Cooperative driven mechanics. 👪 Gameplay moments that require the players to collaborate and communicate. 😄 Casually Enjoyable . The game should be enjoyed in casual settings, it should be stress relieving rather than stress building, and it should be easily engaged with. 🥳 Short session length, up to 15-minutes. 🥳 Low learning curve, medium mastery curve. 🥳 Multi-taskable, allowing people to have split attention while playing. 🥳 Themes and enemies that are whimsical and light fantasy. 🥳 No gratiuitous violence, sexual or mature content. 🥳 No overly complicated or devisive content. 🥳 Only positive reinforcement, never any punishments or penalties. 🥳 Allow people to disengage and re-engage at a whim with no penalties.

Players progress faster in groups and are able to directly help each other using abilities. The game is optimally played with a pre-existing community, but solo players can join any team with no restrictions. 🏆 Competition . Teams will have statistics📊 of individual performance (damage, healing, …) displayed at all times which will motivate competitive players to top the team leaderboard. This allows shareable moments within communities. 🔥 Destruction . The combat will cause over the top destruction to the environment and enemie, in a fireworks-display comical manner. It should be suprising, enjoyable, and candy for your eyes. 💪 Progression . In a 15 minute session players will rapidly progress in their class. In the metagame players can empower their class by expending earned currency. 🔎 Discovery . Players will be able to discover a variety of unique and different environments, classes, achievements, and enemies over their sessions. ",

    "content": "🧭 2D Movement . Players can move around the world in the horizontal plane, ie unable to jump or move vertically. 🗡️ Auto Attacks . Characters will attack the nearest threat automatically, players need not aim attacks or choose targets. This is a characteristic mechanic of the bullet-heaven genre. 🔥 Character classes have unique abilities . Each character class has unique abilities that can be used to directly help team mates. For example: 🛡️ Paladin: Block and reflect attacks. 🦎 Tamer: Can tame invaders into friendly pets. 🌷 Druid: Can grow defensive fauna. ⚠️ Telegraphed abilities and attacks . All abilities and attacks, from friends or enemies, will be telegraphed to allow the players to react to it. Players are able to get out of the way of enemy attacks and ensure they take advantage of any team mates abilities (eg a heal). 💪 Rapid Progression and ability unlocks . At the start of each session, a character is at level 1 and can rapidly climb to a maximum level of 10 during a 15 minute session. Each level provides one new ability, chosen from a set of five random abilities. Players will all level up at the same time and will see the abilities other players choose, so they can strategize to choose the same abilities or have a mixture of abilities on the team. 🙏 Stacked abilities . When a player uses an ability, such as an area based heal, other players will have the opportunity to stack their ability on top of it. This allows for stronger abilities that are only possible with numerous collaborating team mates. For example, an area based heal that has numerous stacks will have a wider area of effect and healing potency. ",

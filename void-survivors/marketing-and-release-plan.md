## High Level Strategy

Void Survivors allows players to join an existing game session by using a simple web browser link. The marketing strategy is entirely focused on engaging existing synchronous gaming communities to motivate players to join existing sessions, share their own session, and eventually have the community provide a permanant session link.

The strategy focuses on syncrhonous game communities, ie Discord and Twitch, as opposed to asychronous forums such as Reddit or Facebook, as the optimal way the game is discovered is via players sharing a link to communities to join their session.

To achieve this, the following strategies will be deployed:
* Engage existing Discord gaming communities.
* Foster a Discord gaming community around the game.
* Sponsor game streamers to play sessions with their communities.

## Strategy: Engaging existing discord gaming communities

This strategy is about acquiring new players through existing gaming communities.

To achieve this, the following steps will be undertaken:
1. Identify Discord gaming communities, join, and engage*.
2. Occasionally post a link to an existing session for other community members to join.
3. Engage the community managers to post a permanant link to a session, this allows their community to be discovered by other players in game - increasing their community sizes.

* It's important to engage as some communities have posting restrictions, which disallow new users from posting.

# Ideas
* Join a bunch of gaming communities and share a link to it
* Who is your project for?
* Psychographic segmentation -- venn diagram for game, middle is game, what contributes to the game
* What do they play?
* Where do they hangout?
* Choose a few targetted marketing streams (not dev diary)
* Launching on armor games, newgrounds, ...
* What communities exist?

* Later behavioral segmentation as analytics becomes available, able to target classes, teams.
  * Personalize
  * Segment based on behavior
  eg players acting efficently, competitively
  players acting socially

* Later demographic segmentation within the bounds of GDPR compliance

* Later geographic segmentation as analytics becomes available, able to target sales and skins.

? Can i gather psychgraphic information from existing communities
? Do the behaviors of those communities reinforce the behaviors I want
  * Sharing links
  * Cooperation
  * Competition

? What existing titles exist in the realm of twitch communities interacting with streamers

? Do the psychographics reinforce the player fantasies?
  * Do they want to play together?
  * Are the competitive?

* What are the interests of these people?

Reinforcement: They are already part of a community and thus cooperation, socialization are important to them

Reinforcement: Existing discord communities for dark and darker, gtfo, ...

* Is it a blue ocean, green ocean, ..?

* Create different personalities to market/design to?





Target: Existing communities

Self-Publishing: If you are adopting a self-publishing strategy name your key priorities. If you are new to this, make sure you test your ideas with experienced developers.

Platform engagement: What platforms are you targeting and what you are doing to actively engage with them for positioning on online markets if possible.

User Acquisition Strategies: Particularly if self-publishing.

Competitor/Previous Products: Listing competitor or previously released games shows that you have done market research. Avoid listing market leaders and breakout titles- if you are an indie dev, you can't compete with Doom or Mario! Check sites where you can get good information around sales figures and review performance. Remember console providers rarely make these figures public so be ready to compensate for that in your comparisons. Create a table and link or import the media.

* Create own community
    * GTFO
    * D&D

aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> ☁️ Psychographic Segmentation </h2> <p>Psychographic segmentation is used to define personas which guide development and marketing in Void Survivors. The following personas are the target personas for the game until release.</p><hr /> <h3 id="-persona-community-member"> <a href="#-persona-community-member" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="-persona-community-member"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 🤝 Persona: Community Member </h3> <p>The community member is someone who is looking to socialize, interact, and fit in with a community. They want to feel integrated within community and are looking to cooperate and compete within it. They are open to new experiences as long as they are social in nature. They enjoy competitive and challenging situations where they can personally stand out in their community. They enjoy cooperating with a team to overcome challenges and achieve unique rewards.</p> <p>The community member plays on a low/mid powered PC, laptop, or mobile device. They are highly engaged in the voice chat or text chat of their community, preferring their community chat to an in-game chat, and aren’t entirely focused on the game. They are skilled at video games and are familiar with traditional mechanics, input controls, and tropes.</p> <p>The community member likes achievements and status rewards which can be flaunted within their community, such as high scores and personal achievements.</p> <p>The community member discovers games using the community they are a part of. They tend to play games based on the trends in their community so they can feel integrated.</p> <p>The community member is willing to spend money on rewards that will make them stand out from their community, through unique class or cosmetics, or that provide them recognition and status within their community.</p><hr /> <h3 id="-persona-community-organizer"> <a href="#-persona-community-organizer" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="-persona-community-organizer"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 👉 Persona: Community Organizer </h3> <p>The community organizer is someone who is always looking for games they can play with their friends, family, or community. They are looking for accessible experiences that can be shared with a diverse set of people, with a range of different devices, skills, and tastes. They avoid experiences that may need lots of explaining (rules), that may cause technical difficulties, or be exclusionary to members of their community.</p> <p>The community organizer plays on a high powered PC or on a large screen in a social environment, their community plays on laptops or mobile devices. Their community wants to play together without interruption by other players, and wants the ability to socially interact with each other.</p> <p>The community organizer looks for games that are mechanics focused opposed to story or theme focused. Ideally the game will allow for emergent storytelling which will form stronger bonds in their community through shared experiences and stories. The community organizer will move players on from experiences if they are getting overwhelming or frustrating at the end of the session, and rarely during a session.</p> <p>The community organizer discovers games using filtering in Steam or similar app for cooperative, competitive, couch games, and other specific tags. They will consider a large number of games in their discovery and quickly determine appropriate games by looking at the marketing materials.</p> <p>The community organizer is willing to spend money on rewards that will benefit their entire team and on cosmetics which help themselves stand out from their community.</p><hr /> <h3 id="-persona-transit-player"> <a href="#-persona-transit-player" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="-persona-transit-player"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 🚌 Persona: Transit Player </h3> <p>The transit player is someone who doesn’t have much time to play. They have a personal mobile device or a work PC in which they can play on. They are looking for a quick dopamine hit and stress relief whilst they are on break, awaiting a meeting, or their station while on public transport. They are not entirely focused on the game, as they may be in a distracting or social environment.</p> <p>The transit player is attracted to pick up and play mechanics, they want to jump into the action straight away, and don’t want any risk for putting down the game at a moments notice. They do not engage in voice chat and rarely in text chat to communicate, instead focusing on their solo experience.</p> <p>The transit player is attracted to destruction, combat, and high octane mechanics. They are more excited to join an existing game in the flow of action, opposed to a slow burn in ramping up to the action.</p> <p>The transit player discovers games by top games on mobile store or by hearing about it from a friend or influencer. They will quickly move on from a game if it doesn’t seem to be engaging or enjoyable. They prefer small download size and near-instant experiences.</p> <p>The transit player is willing to spend small amounts of money on spontaneous decisions if they believe it will lead to tangible enjoyment and progression rewards that can be seen immediately.</p><hr /> <h3 id="persona-solo-player"> <a href="#persona-solo-player" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="persona-solo-player"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Persona: Solo Player </h3> <p>This persona is for players that want to play a game and discover team mates to play with.</p> <p>This persona is a secondary focus until the Beta milestone.</p> <p>To be completed by the Producer in the Alpha milestone.

They would like to interact with the developers and express their desires for the game.</p> <p>This persona is a secondary focus until the Beta milestone.</p> <p>To be completed by the Producer in the Alpha milestone.

The marketing strategy is focused on user acquisition by engaging with existing synchronous gaming communities to motivate community members to join existing sessions, start and share their own session, and eventually have the community provide a permanent session link. Further, the strategy focuses on user retention through the formation of a Discord server and an email list.</p> <p>The strategy focuses on synchronous game communities, ie Discord and Twitch, as opposed to asynchronous forums such as Reddit or Facebook, as the optimal way the game is discovered is by players joining a link to a live session shared on a community they are a part of.</p> <p>To achieve this, the following user acquisition strategies will be deployed:</p> <ul> <li>Engage existing Discord gaming communities.</li> <li>Engage players that enjoy Survivors-like genre.</li> <li>Sponsor game streamers to play with their communities.</li> <li>Distribution by platforms with existing player bases.</li> </ul> <p>Further, the following user retention strategies will be deployed:</p> <ul> <li>Foster a Discord gaming community and email list around the game.</li> </ul><hr /> <h3 id="-user-acquisition-strategy-engaging-existing-discord-gaming-communities"> <a href="#-user-acquisition-strategy-engaging-existing-discord-gaming-communities" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="-user-acquisition-strategy-engaging-existing-discord-gaming-communities"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 📌 User Acquisition Strategy: Engaging existing Discord gaming communities </h3> <p>This strategy focuses on acquiring new players through existing gaming communities, specifically Discord communities.</p> <p>Examples of existing Discord gaming communities:</p> <ul> <li>Socializing : 169k members.</li> <li>Tribe Gaming : 90k members.</li> <li>Aura Gaming : 40k members.</li> </ul> <p>To achieve this, the following steps will be undertaken:</p> <ol> <li>Identify Discord gaming communities, join, and engage*.</li> <li>Occasionally post a link to an existing session, looking for online community members to join.</li> <li>Engage the community owners to post a permanent link to a session, this allows their community to be discovered by other players in game - increasing their community size.</li> </ol> <p>*It’s important to engage consistently and for a long period, as some communities have posting restrictions, which disallow new or inactive users from posting.</p> <p>This strategy is common in Reddit/Facebook forums, and it is very hard to cut through the noise without paid promotion. However this strategy is not common in synchronous communities as the lifetime of posts is very short.</p> <p>This strategy is modern, as over the last few years many online communities have moved from Facebook/Reddit to Discord.</p> <p>This strategy focuses on the main user target, that of a person in a gaming community looking to play and interact with others in the community.</p> <p>The final step of this strategy is for communities to post a permalink for Void Survivors in their community, this allows players in their community to join at any time and be placed with others in that community. The main advantage for the community is that it can be organically discovered by players within the game, increasing the community user base. Further incentives are affiliation rewards of purchases by community members, and in-game boosts for community members.</p> <p>This strategy requires no financial investment and a continual small time investment by having accounts active and engaged in a number of gaming communities.</p> <p>This strategy will be executed upon during the Beta milestone and persist into Live Ops, after release.</p><hr /> <h3 id="-user-acquisition-strategy-sponsoring-game-streamers-to-play-with-their-communities"> <a href="#-user-acquisition-strategy-sponsoring-game-streamers-to-play-with-their-communities" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="-user-acquisition-strategy-sponsoring-game-streamers-to-play-with-their-communities"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 📌 User Acquisition Strategy: Sponsoring game streamers to play with their communities </h3> <p>This strategy is about acquiring new players through existing gaming communities around a Twitch streamer.</p> <p>Void Survivors provides a unique and highly interactive way for Twitch streamers to engage with their audience. It provides a lot of value in that alone. Ideally this value for streamers will be enough to motivate streamers to invite their communities without explicit partnership or sponsorship.</p> <p>Twitch streamers like to engage with their audience through a variety of activities, including chatting, content sharing, and games. There are very few games that allow Twitch streamers to interact with their communities, due to player size limits, pay walls, or unfair advantages gained by being able to view the streamers’ screen. Void Survivors is uniquely positioned in that it has no restrictions or drawbacks for sharing.</p> <p>To achieve this strategy, streamers with small followings (~100 CCU) will be engaged with an affiliation partnership on purchases by their viewers and/or sponsorship costs.</p> <p>Ideally streamers with larger audiences will see a trend of smaller streamers engaging with Void Survivors, which motivates them to play and share with their stream.</p> <p>This strategy would benefit from financial investment. If no marketing budget is able to support this effort, then affiliation program’s should be mature and accessible to execute this strategy without sponsorship.</p> <p>This strategy will be executed upon after the Release milestone.</p><hr /> <h3 id="-user-acquisition-strategy-engaging-players-that-enjoy-the-survivors-like-genre"> <a href="#-user-acquisition-strategy-engaging-players-that-enjoy-the-survivors-like-genre" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="-user-acquisition-strategy-engaging-players-that-enjoy-the-survivors-like-genre"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 📌 User Acquisition Strategy: Engaging players that enjoy the Survivors-like genre. </h3> <p>This strategy is about acquiring new players through engaging with players that enjoy the Survivors-like genre through posting on existing game forums and communities.</p> <p>As determined in the <a href="market-research" target="_blank">market research</a> there is a huge amount of players enjoying the Survivors-like genre and are demanding new entrants in this genre.

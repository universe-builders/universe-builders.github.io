# To Do
* 3 minutes

* Why now?
* Why you?
* Why this story?
* Why is now the right time for the story?
* How does this project stand out?
* Really display passion
* Does the story being told match the person telling it?
* classification

* They should feel excited about the project and they should want to advocate for it
* Audience
* Hooks
* Who else would be excited about it?
* The impact on your business if it goes successfully
* Not 70-80% on game vision

* How does it help business: Builds a reusable technical foundation that is unique in it's market positioning

* Inclusion: No matter what you play on or what your skill level, you are welcomed and encouraged to join.

* Justification: More divided world -- fully inclusive game

* Justification: Gaming communities have moved from async comms to sync comms (youtube -> twitch, facebook/reddit -> discord)
    * A game like this wouldn't have thrived in those async environments

* Justification: Loneliness busting (autism and my connection to people through games)
